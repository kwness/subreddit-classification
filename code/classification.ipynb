    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "If a company wants to be successful in marketing their products to prospective customers, they must know their audience. The founders at Everything Meal Prep believe that wholeheartedly, and for that reason, they have gone the distance of hiring us consultants at Online Analysis Co. to help them towards this success. They have done this in the hopes that via our data-driven insights and our ability to create an automated classification system, their meal plan advertisements will only reach customers with matching diets / food interests going forward. This should save them money that would otherwise be spent on ineffective advertising, and conversely, potentially boost sales (if they committed to the same amount of advertising spend). \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, Everything Meal Prep has tasked us with improving their online advertisements hosted on reddit. As their name suggests, they provide customers meal plans consisting of virtually any ingredients. For this task, they want us to focus solely on aiding the performance of their carnivore and vegan meal plan lines. To this end, we must build an accurate binary classification system, determining whether an online person is a carnivore or a vegan. We will do this by analyzing data that we scraped from the subreddits (of Reddit.com) r/vegan and r/carnivore. Hopefully by using natural language processing techniques and testing various classification models, we will arrive at a system that can perfrom this task with the utmost accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, Naive Bayes and logistic regression models will be constructed and evaluated for this task. We also aim to provide Everything Meal Prep with recommendations about how to go about their marketing."

As soon as people feel judged their defence mechanism will kick in and we will loose them.\\n\\nWe need to remember the perspective of someone who eats meat in order to successfully advocate for the vegan lifestyle. What we are advocating for is not just a dietary change but a complete change in how humans relate to other animals and nature on this planet. It cant be understated how much of a colossal change in perspective this is and it's unlikely anyone will go vegan from a single conversation.\\n\\nSomeone coming out of conversation thinking veganism is more reasonable than before is still a massive win for this movement! For many people their perspective on animals has never been challenged, what we should be aiming for is to plant the seed. The two most important tools at our disposal are the Socratic method (asking questions so they investigate their own perspective) and positive encouragement/reinforcement.\\n\\nIt's only a matter of time before animal agriculture as we know it is abolished and the better we get at advocating this change, the more animals will be spared!\""

    "As can be seen in the print outs above, one of the few remaining glaring issue seems to be the representation of new-line spaces as '\\n' or doubles new-line spaces as '\\n\\n'. This may affect word counts when going forward with NLP methods, potentially leading to inaccuracy in our models, so it would be beneficial to remove these from the dataframes using regular expressions, as we will below. By doing so, the dimensionality (and thus, complexity) of our count vectorized dataframes will be reduced."

    "Looking at these distributions and the recorded medians, it is evident that posts on r/vegan are usually longer and that there is probably a max character count for posts (however that may be approximated with the outliers of ~1,750 words observed here). In fact, the median word count on r/vegan is almost double that of r/carnivore. This likely heavily correlates with post length if we were to investigate that feature. These are interesting notions to perhaps keep in mind for future reddit scrapes as well as when thinking about how to execute marketing of our product. r/vegan posters may be more conscientious, for example. \n",

    "These two plots are definitely somewhat intuitive. The 'vegan' and 'carnivore' are understandably the most common words on their respective subreddits. Further, r/vegan's common words reflect attention to animal welfare and human impact, as they actually include 'animal'and 'people' whereas r/carnivore does not. Conversely, r/carnivore seems to use words that vegans would maybe cringe hearing, like 'beef', 'eggs', 'liver', 'chicken', and 'steak'. This was surely an insightful angle to explore, especially for this analysis' purpose. When marketing our meal plans, we must make sure we advertise in a customer-friendly way, using the right words."

    "Given the task at hand, best_nb (Naive Bayes) is the better model. Occurrences of false positives and false negatives here are acceptable -- it would just mean that an advertisement did not land on the right person. Although some money may be wasted here, there is little harm. In fact, a few ads given to the wrong people could maybe help to woo those people to a new diet (the opposite one). \n",

    "Recall and accuracy are more important here. Recall because we would not want to classify a vegan as a carnivore given how adamant that group is about animal rights and other close topics. Accuracy because we want to target potential customers that already eat the kinds of food Everything Meal Prep are producing and advertising. They will be more likely to turn into sales for the company. Thus, we will go with the model using Naive Bayes."

    "Given the results of our model creation and evaluation above, it is evident that Everything Meal Prep can indeed rely on an NLP classification system reliant on user post content for highly accurate targeting of potential customers. While the baseline accuracy rate was 50.12%, our best model, the Naive Bayes estimator paired with a CountVectorizer with tuned parameters, boasts a 95.47% accuracy rate and a 97.13% recall rate which are each very attractive for the task at hand. Everything Meal Prep should go forward with utilizing this model immediately to save on advertising spend and / or boost sales. They can know their audience like the back of their hand using this system, which is what they were initially striving for. The stakeholders in Everything Meal Prep will benefit greatly from the bolstered performance in online marketing that this system promises, as company value will increase on potential higher earnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, there are some insights gathered from the analysis here. When it comes to delivering these advertisements, they should be tailored to the nature of the recipients. As observed above, posts are generally longer on r/vegan, and seem to contain discussions of animals, people, feelings, and more that may fall outside the realm of just diets (going by common words used). These users are perhaps more conscientious, and a well-targeted ad may need to be conveyed in a savvier, more thought-provoking manner. Beyond these assumptions, the company should also simply use these common words sort of like buzzwords / points of fixation. Mentioning how Everything Meal Prep's \"Super Vegan\" diet helps preserve wildlife reserves, for example, may goad a vegan to try the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future steps in aiding Everything Meal Prep in this endeavor would perhaps be performing more grid searches for even better hyperparamters, choosing and evaluating estimators not seen here, and collecting more data from reddit. Each of these may potentially lead to an even better-performing model than the Naive Bayes one found here."
