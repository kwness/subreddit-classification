carnivore,Help With Feeling hungry,I’ve been dealing with severe Crohn’s disease for two years now and decided to fully embrace the carnivore elimination diet after doing lots of research. I was eating a natural wholes foods diet previously and made an immediate switch over this diet. The only issue that I’ve had with this diet is that today I wasn’t very hungry. I’ve only been on the cd for one week and really want to stick with it but I don’t know why i couldn’t eat as much today. Any tips on achieving hunger between meals would be greatly appreciated.
carnivore,Can Carnivore help illness brought on my infection/virus?,"Hi all

I've been dealing with some rather severe autoimmune issues for about 18 months (chronic joint pain/ fatigue etc). Tested negative to most things and my rheumatologist best guess is I have some form of chronic reactive arthritis triggered by a bacterial infection I had not long beforehand.

Can carnivore help with issues like this? I'm going to give it a go regardless, but as the initial cause wasn't due to food I'm curious if it's helped anyone in a similar situation."
carnivore,Fishy taste to grass finished beef,"I ordered a 1/4 share of beef all grass fed/finished. The meat has a fishy flavor to it almost like salmon. it’s not gamey like grass fed meat usually is, just fishy… kind of unpleasant tbh. I’ve had grass finished beef in the past and it was definitely more gamey tasting but not fishy at all. This is a first.

I’ve read it could be do to the higher omega 3 ratios in the grass finished beef? However I’ve had grass fed beef so many times and I’ve never experienced a fishy flavor.

Has anyone else experienced this from grass fed/finished beef?"

carnivore,High uric acid should I be worried.,"Hello,
I've been on the carnivore diet for couple of years now with few fallouts here and there on Xmas/birthdays and such. Today I decided to do some blood tests and my uric acid is 627, when the normal line should be between 200 and 420. Should I be worried?

I eat almost the same things every day. Pork shoulder steak or Pork ribs, 3 eggs with about 100 grams store bought bacon, lard, 10 grams of 90% dark chocolate, and I take vit D supplement.

I feel fine but just wanted to get some opinions if I shouls be worried."
carnivore,How much butter do you eat in a typical day?,"I'm working on my budget spreadsheet and trying to understand how much butter does it make sense to plan to eat in a day.

I'm obviously a beginner at carnivore, and grew up with the typical ""fat is evil"" mentality, so I'm trying to understand... 

Is it normal to eat 1/3 of a stick of butter per day? Or half? Or a whole stick? Or more? (Where I live a stick of butter is 250g/8oz.)"
carnivore,Pork Butt into Steaks,"A week or so ago the store I work at had a sale for Pork Butts for $0.97/pound.   
I've never taken advantage of any sales on these because they really are huge chunks of meat (especially for just one person). And then on the last day of the sale a lady told me that she was having the meat market cut the butts down into steaks. I had no idea that this is how pork steaks were made. I was too late to get any at the time, so I got a rain check.  
The store got some in stock yesterday and naturally I was off, doing laundry. I didn't get to the store until later in the evening and when I got to the store the meat market lady had already started breaking down the department for the evening. But she kept the two butts back in the cooler for me.  
I came back this morning for the meat to be cut up. And WOW, these steaks are monsters! The butcher cut them into 1/2"" slices. I got 20 steaks out of the two butts. A single steak is about the size of an entire dinner plate!   
I loaded up the freezer. I would like to load up the freezer more often, maybe not so many pork steaks, but a lot of my plans rely on me filling up the freezer.  


 If I ever get around to following my plan"

I realized I was chewing gum all the time because I have terrible teeth and after eating meat and being stuck at my desk, my mouth would get kinda gross.  Turns out the gum had aspartame and I didn't catch it when I checked!! And I was chewing lots of it! 😔 I just threw it all in the trash and I will see if that works moving forward.  Hope this helps someone else!!"
carnivore,Does anyone else here eat venison? I'm looking for good ways to soak some fat into it,"I was thinking of heating a pan of tallow and pouring it on to venison steaks and letting it hopefully soak together a bit.

Thank you heaps"
carnivore,"Packaging and storage, what do you use?","I want to avoid plastics, but don't know where to start. I notice a lot of butchers use plastic now, so maybe I can't avoid it at the point of purchase. I buy a few roasts, slice them up, then freeze them, right now I'm using sandwich bags, but I know that's not a great option. I do use glass containers for leftovers in the fridge, but they're quite small, and expensive, so not good for the freezer meat."

carnivore,"Am I the only one that slices up beef brisket for steaks, fat-cap/collagen and all?","I don't know if this is the most obvious secret in the world, or I'm just the dunce in the corner... but it works for me. $80 for 30 lbs of brisket at the local national grocery chain. Roughly 20~ steaks with the consistency of sirloin, strip, and ribeye.

I salt both sides of the brisket, leave covered at room temp for 2 hours, slice into about .75-1 inch steaks, and then salt the new faces. Leave out at room temp for 4 hours. Dab dry with paper towels prior to searing in a skillet or grilling... melted butter or liquid duck fat for cooking oil.

Usually eat a steak with 6-10 scrambled eggs, sue me, but I add black/red/and cayenne pepper to the eggs."
carnivore,"Is it possible to learn to love soft bones, cartilage etc.?","As long as I knew myself I always hated bone-in meats such as ribs or chicken wings but now I want to consume not only lean meat but all the tendons, ligaments and cartilage of the animal. 

Thing is I'm very picky when it comes to stuff like that and people always say how much meat I wasted on the bone when I eat chicken wings, because if I take even a small bite of connective tissue I immediately gag and become close to throw up.

I'm trying to get used to it nowadays, but everytime I bite into the cartilage I still immediately gag. 

Has anyone got over this? I envy people who can leave clean bones after having wings"
carnivore,no consecutive bad days?,"hey all. been carnivore for almost 6 months. organ meats plus a lotta beef have changed me. I can now deadlift 300 pounds.

I’m just wondering if anyone can relate to this? I’ve been prey to depression and lethargy my whole life. 

but on carnivore, it seems that I can bounce back from bad days pretty quickly. like maybe I’ll be depressed for a day. but then the next day wake up feeling motivated and optimistic again. 

I will note that lifting, sunlight, and cold showers in the morning definitely help me get out of depression.

but yeah… I do feel like all these nutrient dense meats help me bounce back from depressing days really quickly.

I have had some struggle to come clean with everyone that i am friggin lion lol apart from close family. I have a feeling people would look at me funny if they watched me go thru an entire bowl of ground beef.

carnivore,Bone broth suggestions,"Hi -

I know a lot of people make their own bone broth. I'm not going to be one of them. I've tried some commercial bone broths and haven't really found one I've liked. Any suggestions for brands available in most stores? 

I drink broth made from a cube or Better than Bouillon with no problem. What is the difference between them and something labeled 'bone broth'? Am I losing out on any nutrition if I just drink the Better than Bouillon? 

Also, realizing that we don't get all of our nutrition from one place, does it really make any difference if the bouillon is a bit lacking compared to bone broth? Won't I just make up the nutrition from the other foods I eat?   Thanks."
carnivore,Have any of you lowered your CAC score or heard of anyone doing it with carnivore? Asking for my mother.,"My mom (who eats the SAD) found out she has a higher CAC score and of course now the doctor wants to put her on statins.  I would prefer that she fixes her diet instead and after she's seem my great success with the carnivore lifestyle I think I could almost talk her in to it.    


My question is if anyone has ever either lowered their CAC score with dietary measures or known anyone who has or can offer any advice that I could use to convince her to try a dietary approach vs. a statin?   Statins made my dad's dental health fall apart before he stopped taking them finally so she's not super eager to take them either so I sense an opening with her."

carnivore,Quarterly Elimination Diet Thread," 

This thread is for people doing the carnivore diet for discussion of their experience adding foods back  after total elimination (trying to uncover inflammation or allergy sources etc) and their reactions to the reintroduction of non carnivore  foods, one at a time.

You must have eaten a carnivore diet for 30 days (an elimination cycle) before posting about any reintroduction of other foods. This is not for posting about your one off cheat day or how you ""fell off the wagon"". 

Be smart  about this: Add suspected foods back one at a time and give yourself  some time before adding more. Adding three things at once and having a reaction wont tell you what caused it."

carnivore,"Fat, eating fat, cooking fat, rendering fat, questions about fat.","I got a few questions related to eating straight fat. Like, for example, the fat around the edge of a steak or chop of meat. I got a whole pig recently, I even helped the guy butcher it. Anyways, some of the chops have thick strips of fat, up to an inch or so thick at some parts. Would you guys eat all that side fat along with the meat? Do you set it aside for broth? Feed it to your pet? How do you like to do it?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I've noticed the other day, we got treated out to a steakhouse, and they cooked the steak soooooo deliciously. The fat on the side of the steak was sooooo soft and buttery, it just melted as you ate it. I have yet to be able to replicate the soft buttierness of the fat on a steak or pork chop in my kitchen. Do you guys know how to make that magic happen?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I have been rendering a lot of fat into lard. How do you guys do this? I've been cutting it up into little pieces, cooking it in a pot, and straining out the little pieces, pouring the liquid into a jar. Then, the little pieces I salt and eat them as a snack. I feel like I'm not cooking them as tastefully as I could, though. Isn't there something like pork rinds or something, that is crispy fat cooked up? Or does that need to have the skin or something? Idunno, mine taste just ok, maybe a little burnt. Or am I just not quite adapted to enjoy the intensity of straight fat like that? Any thoughts?

Last question. I raise a lot of rabbits, and like the taste a lot (plus they're essentially free meat) but they are a lean meat. If I just add a lot of pork fat or butter to them, is that just as good as eating a fattier animal?"

Is this ''safe''? Will the meat turn in six days or so? Any tips or experience doing this? I'm guessing I would want to remove the excess blood from the bag the roast comes in before putting it in the fridge?

When I broke, I noticed that my appetite was significantly lower than before. I was eating far less and I was noticing so much more quickly when I was full. I used to eat and eat and eat and would almost never realize I was full until it was way too late. 

I did have some pretty bad bloating and a bad stomachache yesterday, but I didn’t beat myself up about it and I just got back to Carnivore. By this morning, I pretty much felt back to normal.

It amazed me at how much my appetite and my response to food had changed in just a month. And while I didn’t feel great after eating pizza and quesadillas and drinking a 42 oz sugary margarita, I was also amazed at how quickly my body bounced back once I started feeding it properly again. 

This lifestyle feels so much more sustainable than I had imagined, and I’m feeling extremely optimistic about continuing in the future! For anyone who is just starting or is still in the early stages like me, hopefully this offers some encouragement!"
carnivore,Irish carnivores where do you get your salt?,"Scéal Capall 

So I've been using Pink Himalayan the last week but after a little research it's apparently  trash. Can't get Redmond's Real Salt in Dunnes but Holland and Barrett are selling [this](https://www.hollandandbarrett.ie/shop/product/holland-barrett-coarse-sea-salt-60091008). What you guys think?"
carnivore,Carnivore diet without cooking hardware?,"I don't have a stove to cook meat, but have a microwave and a refrigerator, what are some suggestions to get on a carnivore diet? I was looking at grass-fed burger patties I can microwave, would it be somehow less beneficial or more harmful because I'm not cooking it or it's microwave-ready?"

I carefully went through the rules on my last post and still, held for moderation. How in the world are we supposed to ask questions?"
carnivore,"Trying to add some meat back in, starting with poultry, but most is fed with soy. Help!!!","I am trying to add back in some meats to my diet, starting with those that can be more easily digestible.

I'd been having organic and uncured turkey bacon for some days now, just added in regular ground turkey last night. Have been having stomach cramping since i've done this, which leads me to believe that these guys are being fed soy which i'm highly sensitive too! What gives? Is it possible to find soy free poultry in the grocery stores? I work at a health food store and I'm doubtful that it would even be there.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so frustrated by this soy obsession because it means that now meat is harder for me to get and i'm already poor and quite busy so scouting it out is not my idea of a good time. What to do?"
carnivore,Grass fed liver in San Diego?,Looking to buy a few pounds before leaving back home
carnivore,My blood pressure has normalized,"I just wanted to report a small but (I think) revealing change. 

For most of my adult life, my blood pressure has ran on the low side (100-110/50-55). Nurses, doctors, phlebotomists used to say positive things about it like they were congratulating me, but over time I came to understand it as a result of adrenal fatigue and fatigue in general. 

Since September, I’ve donated plasma regularly - sometimes twice a week. I’ve been doing carnivore full time since early March, and since then I’ve noticed my blood pressure consistently creep up to more normal levels - 115-120/60-65. 

While the metrics are telling, I’ve also noticed that some of the symptoms of low blood pressure have gone away. When I get up fast from laying down or crouching, the dizziness, light-headedness, and tunnel vision used to almost knock me over. Now it’s minimal. 

It’s a small metric and a small victory, but I’ll take it. Anything that demonstrates that my body is achieving normalcy is a huge win for me."
carnivore,Wait til hungry vs eat at certain times,"I’m curious about this. Let’s say you want to eat a good meal at 6 AM to get you through your work day. But the carnivore plan is to wait until you’re hungry. 

What is the benefit of waiting until you’re hungry vs anticipating your hunger and eating before you get hungry? Is there any science here?"
carnivore,cod liver is... delicious ?!!,"Had some cod liver today, I bought it but left it to sit in my pantry. I'm generally not a fan of seafood, so I was a bit scared. Finally mustered up some courage to eat it, and blew me away by how delicious it was. Smells like tuna, but a bit  weaker. There really is not strong taste at all, and it melts in your mouth, just like butter."
carnivore,Most nutritionally dense lard/fat/tallow/suet?,"Basically just as the title asks. I haven’t been able to find good data on nutrients per oz or gram. Does anyone have any that has been studied? When I say nutritionally sense, I mean  which types have more vitamins and the like (maybe aminos, omegas? I’m not a scientist unfortunately). 

I currently use organic, grass fed beef tallow from a popular brand on Amazon. I’ve also tried chicken fat (meh), pork fat (such amazing flavor, but I just feel like it isn’t good for me idk), duck fat (nice velvety texture and flavor, but too much just was gross). 

I don’t experience any sort of gross with beef tallow. But it has to be the organic and grass fed stuff because I’ve had some that isn’t and it just feels immensely processed. 

But yeah with the good stuff, I literally will supplement a scoop out of the jar if I need something quick to go with midday vitamins (don’t take em on an empty stomach, need to bind to something). I feel like it might be the best but again, can’t find data. 

Anyways, thank you! Hope this helps everyone."

carnivore,Should any form of preservative be avoided?,I've heard conflicting info about this. Some cured meats I enjoy contain some salt preservatives so I'm really curious if this is something that should be completely avoided on a carnivore diet.
carnivore,Sous vide without searing,Has anyone tried sous vide meat and not searing the crust. Is it eadible just to bring meat to a temperature and eat it straight out of vacuum bag? What does it taste like? Im thinking about buying sous vide machine just for that. My motivation is not burning even the thinnest part of my food.
carnivore,Foamy Urine Proteinuria?,"Hey guys, I’m fairly new to Carnivore, about 9 days in now. I feel good, clothes are looser, energy is up, and appetite is completely under control, but I digress. 

Today I noticed that when I urinated that there was quite a bit of foam in the bowl post-urination. Keep in mind this was around 9:00pm in the evening, so not in the morning. I didn’t think anything of it at first, but as I got to thinking I recalled something about foamy urine being related to kidney function. As I googled this, I found something called proteinuria, which is something that happens when there is protein that has leaked into your urine due to poor kidney function. 

This has me worried, because obviously I’m increasing my protein intake quite a bit since starting this lifestyle change, and it does have me feeling a little nervous. Does anyone know if this is normal or has happened to them while doing carnivore?"
carnivore,"3 months in, would appreciate some advice/opinions","I’m 2 days away from 3 months of very strict carnivore(beef, salt, tallow and water). Mentally I feel very good, anxiety and depression have subsided a considerable amount and my overall mood has increased.        

My issue is however, I still have low energy and feel fatigued pretty easily. Im eating 3 lbs of 80/20 ground beef with a good amount of tallow every day for most days, and some steaks and other cuts about 2-3 times a week. I work a construction job that is pretty physically demanding and do body weight workouts 4-6 times a week. I suspect I would benefit from more calories, but it’s already difficult for me to get down 3 lbs in a day so I was wondering if adding dairy would help.        

I started this diet to heal an eczema like skin condition, which I haven’t seen any improvement on yet. So my fear is, I don’t want to start adding things too early if the healing is right around the corner, but the low energy is taking it’s toll, so I feel stuck. I’d love to hear your guys’ thoughts and If you’ve made it this far, thank you."

carnivore,First four months were great now but now I'm constantly fatigued,"Hi everyone, thanks for being here. This community has been so open and informative.

I grew up in a negligent household where I was malnourished constantly. When I moved out I thought to ""treat"" myself with a plant based diet ... my budding ailments (eczema, arthritis, depression, PMDD) only seemed to get worse.

I'm 26 now, and early this year had problems where my uterus couldn't ""hold"" onto my blood - I bled every day for two months. My acupuncturist was able to treat me with Gui Pi Tang and Moxibustion but suggested that in the long term, I really up my meat consumption. It was around this time that I also discovered Mikaila Peterson, so I dove into carnivore, eating primarily steaks, ground beef, ground pork, bacon, BUTTER, goat cheese, and strained yogurt/lebneh, sometimes a king salmon fillet.

The first four weeks were great. A big juicy steak made me want to sing! I feel like for the first time I'm genuinely baseline level happy. I used to consider myself chronically fatigued, but found myself able to go to two ballet classes and still have energy to garden or study all in one day. I immediately noticed that my skin felt thicker and more supple instead of crepey and constantly dry and flaky. My joint pain and instability went away. For those who are into TCM, my tongue went from being scalloped with a white coating to being plump and wet and pink and round.

But this week I'm exhausted! I nap 1-2 hours every day, and wake up with a headache. I was always slim, but now I'm getting into 4/6 pack territory.

I suspected that maybe the issue was not enough fat. I've been trying to eat a nob of butter with each bite of steak but find that i can't even finish a .75LB steak that way. Whereas before I would wake up thinking about a big piece of chuck eye, now I almost felt aversion or indifference?

Can anyone relate? What gives? Is fat the issue and how can i get more of it?"
carnivore,Seasonings too strong?,"Has anyone else noticed, that after a while, you get sensitive to spices? Just put a few shakes of black pepper on my eggs, and now it smells gross to me.  Took a bite and tastes hotter than I remember.

Had garlic butter the other day and it tasted weirdly chemical and spicy to me.

Is this normal?"
carnivore,Hernia?,"My dad has a herniated disk on his back, and just told me he thinks it's pretty hopeless. Does anyone have an experiences with carnivore helping relieve the pain during crises? I really don't like seeing my dad suffer like that."
carnivore,Bellow fellow carnivores! Question about online meat/organs!,"I am hunting for an affordable source of beef organs, primarily liver, and suet for tallow. I have never ordered any meats online. I usually go to a local butcher but have recently moved and the butcher is too far away. I have yet to locate a solid butcher nearby with organs, suet or tallow. 

Let me know where you guys buy your meats/organs and if you have a source for tallow that’s ready to go. Preferably an affordable source! 

Thanks again carnivore fam!! Stay healthy, eat meat!!"
carnivore,Anyone here notice a reduction in allergies?,"Hey. I'm not on the carnivore diet, but I'm thinking about it.

I've had allergy issues all my life, and wondering if this kind of thing has helped anyone before with that.

I live on a farm and am around a lot of farmers, so I have a fantastic access to good quality food of the plant and animal variety.

I raise, rabbits, and egg layers at home, and am good friends with a few great pig sheep  and cattle farmers. So it's very easy for me to get lots of good, unsprayed, pasture raised, naturally grown foods

I also grow lots of veggies and have tons of super fresh veggies around. You never sell 100% of everything, so there's lots that naturally I just eat when they're leftover from a market or something. So it would be a big challenge for me to not eat them.

I love the taste of bread and sugar and stuff, but its easier for me to avoid them since I gotta go to the store to get them and they're not growing all around me.

I think if I knew some people who have cleared away allergies with a carnivore diet, though, it would probably motivate me to try it out."
carnivore,PSA - If you take supplements (like I do) purchase Bovine Gelatin Capsules and remake your pills!,"For those of you trying to stay strict Animal product while taking a supplement here and there. Most supplements on the market come in a capsule made from vegetable Cellulose.

Gelatin is made from decaying animal hides, boiled crushed bones, and the connective tissues of cattle and pigs

I found [this article](https://chriskresser.com/food-for-mold-illness-what-to-eat-and-what-to-avoid/#Foods_to_Avoid_if_You_Have_Mold_Illness) that explains how the mold and mycotoxins in the grain that is fed to the animal affects the meat.

This was obviously not sustainable. When I switched to the carnivore diet I didn’t even have a scale, but I could see my body was cutting fat. 

Yesterday I saw I was getting to that really satisfying point before you start getting really lean. I decided to weigh myself honestly expecting to be around 75-80kg. 

I am in fact 101kg. I’ve shed a lot of fat and Gained muscle. I haven’t even gone to the gym I just go for a 10km walk 3 times a week.

carnivore,Alcoholism &amp; sugar addiction and protein,"I have an alcohol addiction. And as all alcoholics do, I've tried all sorts of ""hacks"" and ""tricks"".

Surprisingly, i had a lot of success with very high protein diet. Which for me is carnivore + whey protein. I am at about 200g of protein per day (could not have done that without whey).

Does anyone else feel like their alcoholism improved for no reason on carnivore? Ever since i started a very high protein diet my cravings diminished 95%. I have not deinked since.

Also, sugar cravings diminished 90% on high protein."

carnivore,Ground Beef Question,Can you eat too much ground beef? My daily meal is 1lb of 80/20 ground beef and a few eggs. The problem here is I cannot really afford grassfed/finished so I just eat corn fed beef. Am I going to get e.coli or mad cow disease or something low key I am kind of worried because I eat this every single day and people say don't eat low quality beef.

carnivore,"Without too much detail, how frequent are your bowel movements?","I finally had one today. It's been at least 3 or 4 days since my last one. I've had no abdominal pain to indicate any type of constipation. So to my surprise, when I felt it coming on I honestly got a little....excited? Hard to describe, but it's a strange thing no doubt. It was quick, clean, and little to no odor. What a wild lifestyle.  Currently on day 6 of 60. Happy I made this choice because I feel fantastic."
carnivore,Just completed my first day!,"I’ve had 2 steaks today and was wondering what is the most optimal way to eat the steak like well done, medium, rare etc. thanks guys"
carnivore,I can't believe the results.,"So I hit my fist on the table and said it's time for a diet. It's been almost 4 weeks. (Will be on Saturday) since then I haven't eaten anything other than meat, eggs and cheese. 

4 weeks ago I've weighted almost 110kgs.

At the moment of writing this I weigh 101.5kg

That's over 2kgs lost a week! 
The results are incredible. 
I haven't even started working out. 
All of this was only from diet.

I never feel hungry and have way more energy overall. 

It's been great and I think I will be staying for another month to see what will happen. I am trying to get to 88kgs. I have never had such amazing results so fast. 

+ The food I make and eat is Soo good.
The only negative is the amount of time that I need to get it all out of my teeth went out the roof. Flossing necessary after most meals."
carnivore,"""Carnivore"" on only fish and eggs?","So, I'm wanting to try a carnivore diet as an extreme elimination diet option to help with my severe chronic illness (digestive issues to the extreme). However, I physically cannot swallow red meats or chicken etc. at the moment because my entire esophagus is so inflamed. Not as in ""I'd rather not"" - I can't. Things get stuck and I end up in the ER. Only animal proteins I can get down is fish and eggs. Might try chicken liver as well. Is this acceptable to start off on for a carnivore diet? Desperately hoping my situation will improve so I can eat red meat later on but for now it's just not happening. Still want to try to get some benefits, and I bloat up like a balloon and get body pains when I eat plants rn."

I want to get another oven to grill with because I fear I'm going to wreck my wife's expensive oven.  How do others grill their meat and how do you avoid the fat spitting on your elements?

carnivore,Has anyone seen improvements with seasonal allergies?,I am starting the carnivore diet today to see if it will help with my seasonal allergies. They are the worst they’ve ever been. I was just wondering if anyone has seen improvements with this diet
carnivore,Lower fat ruminant meat for better digestion?,"I'm trying to have a period of 100% carnivore (mainly to heal eczema, improve mental health and test exercise performance). I often stop after 2-4 days as the unexpected loose stools are so unpleasant and time consuming.  


I have been eating meat based, deriving the majority of my nutrition from ruminant meat for the past 6+ months. I mainly eat beef rump, beef chuck, lamb shoulder chops and 4 eggs per day. Although not strict carnivore during this time, I would have expected my digestion to adapt to meat in this time.  


Would eating 100% slow cooked beef shin (a seemingly leaner cut) be a suitable approach? I would like a leaner cut to improve digestion while I adapt, though it seems to still have some fat that would prevent me from rabbit starvation etc. I'd like to do this and slowly add fats in depending on how my digestion goes. It also happens to be a cheaper cut which is an added bonus."
carnivore,Any other ex overweight people struggle to make themselves eat enough on carnivore?,As an ex overweight person I've gotten used to portion control. I'm loving carnivore but the one struggle I have is getting over the mental aspect that I have to eat more. I used to intermittent fast while eating normally but now I'm eating 3 meals a day and feeling physically great but mentally I'm always judging myself for my massive plates. Any tips or input from people who have similar experiences?
carnivore,"Help, losing too much weight. Need to find higher calorie options","Never thought this would be my issue but Carnivore for 3-4 months, very little dairy and minimal Brussels/asparagus for veg.  I typically fast until 2-3pm then two meals a day but lately I have not been nearly as hungry and having trouble forcing myself to eat.  I have been lifting and running 3-4x a week."
carnivore,Low fat vs high fat carnivore,"Have any of you experienced low and high fat carnivore? Was there a difference?
I don’t just mean low fat for two days or vice versa. I mean for longer periods of time. But still, if you felt a difference in such a short time, let me know, but also make it known that it was in a shorter time span.
Thanks a lot!"
carnivore,Can one expect beef liver to help acne problems?,"Going carnivore definitely helps reduce tons of inflammation on my skin, however I noticed I still get mild acne, even on beef/water only.  

I’ve never eaten liver until yesterday.  I also noticed not slathering/drying my skin and being in the sun helps. 

People always say liver and the vitamin A content will help the skin tremendously although others say they notice nothing.  

Should I expect it to help at eating roughly 3 oz daily?  

If anyone has any anecdotal experience with skincare/liver for their acne it’d be much appreciated:)"
carnivore,"Store bought, “normal” butter","Hello.
I know that people like to eat lots of fat with carnivore diets.

I'd like to make some jerky so that I can have food when I go away from home and such. Last time I did it, I used acidic marinades and it fucked my throat after a while."
carnivore,I stink less ... and it's not just my opinion,"One unexpected benefit of carnivore for me, is I have less body odor, especially under my armpits - in fact, I stopped wearing deodorant entirely. I go to the gym at least three times per week, and while of course I sweat when I'm working out, no smell. In fact, I sweat less in general.

I wasn't exactly stinky before (at least I think that I wasn't?), but I definitely have less body odor now. This has been confirmed by a person or two in my life.

Has anyone else experienced this or something like it?"
carnivore,3 days into carnivore and I have a question about poop :-/ Is this creating malabsorption issues? Should I simply stop???,"I didn’t poop the first two days and then boom, that don’t trust a far thing you guys talk about happened. All good though, 


Except it’s weird floaty poop that has freaking fat in it! !! It’s like a mix of what my poop normally looks like with this really light colored stuff which I’m assuming is fat. 


Yes. I took pictures and am comparing them to poop from google images. It’s totally fat in my stool. 


I’m worried and bummed out. I feel really calm eating this way and was excited fore my psoriasis and acne to clear up. I enjoy the food and feel it’s nutritionally sound. I’m just worried about this possibly creating an absorption/digestion issues or maybe exposing one ? Maybe I’m not built for this? 


Im spiraling lmao"

carnivore,How Much Bacon Do You Eat?,"As the title says, wondering how much bacon you all are eating. I've been carnivore  for 106 days (but who's counting) and eat roughly 10-12 lbs of bacon a month.  The rest mostly consists of Rib-Eye steaks &amp; hamburger in different forms. 

Granted, after cooking that lb of bacon there's only about 5oz left. When people ask and I tell them, they immediately think I'm crazy. 😄

I've seen several benefits in the short time I've been on carnivore, including 25lbs down.

So, what's your take on the bacon?  I'm not really worried about the fat but not too sure about nitrates/nitrites."
carnivore,What seasonings can be used?,"Hi everyone I have been browsing this sub a bit and am curious. From what I understand, cooking over wood is okay. But technically speaking, the flavor imparted in meat from a fire are compounds that come from a plant material when you burn it. Of course, quantity varies and it's not like eating a whole plant. But those plant compounds would still be in your food.

So given that, does anyone here use seasonings? For instance, pepper, paprika, chili powder, cumin etc? 

For instance, when grilling steaks, I like to take some rosemary, soak it in some butter, and brush the steak with it. It imparts some of the flavor (and obviously some oils/compounds from the sprigs) onto the meat. But ofc I never eat the actual herb. This would seem even more comparable to how the flavor comes from the wood (ie you don't eat the actual wood).

Just genuinely curious what you all think."
carnivore,Dealing with bad breath?,"Is anyone else dealing with their breath smelling bad on this diet? My boyfriend and I have both noticed that our breath smells worse after eating meat.

carnivore,What kind of sauces or seasoning do you use?,"For the last two months I’ve only been eating red meat and chicken with salt or garlic salt. It’s getting boring and I started craving spicy food. 

I know some of you only use salt but I need variety in my life if I want to continue long term. 

Which seasoning and sauces do you use?"
carnivore,Bought some beef patties from a local butcher and they're preseasoned.,"And I'd like to know if brown sugar seasoned beef patties - from my local butcher shop - is okay?

If its too much sugar should I limit them or can I have one or two patties per day?

Next time I'll obviously get the plain patties..."
carnivore,Chicken makes me feel euphoric,"I've noticed most people seem to claim that ruminant meat (red meat) makes them feel mentally better than poultry like chicken but I've often noticed the opposite. My skin does feel a bit more oily and off after eating chicken sometimes (just salt and pepper roasts or plain butter fried chicken) but I do seem to get this weird euphoria after eating it. Like, I really feel alive and kind of ecstatic. I've always gorged on a lot of mutton, lamb, beef and camel but they just don't really do that for me. Any of noticed something similar? And what do you think is the cause?"
carnivore,Personality changes on carnivore?,"Has anyone had any cool changes to their personality/hobbies on carnivore?

I’m learning how to dance. Also I’m way more interested in lifting heavy weights today. Also I can meditate for 20 minutes with ease. Also I feel more in touch with God. I like cold water way more. I also am getting up at 5AM consistently. I like sunlight way more. Also I’m reading 20-30 pages of self-help books a day now. 

I think the whole dancing thing is the most unusual change though. I’ve always been kinda into God/meditation and stuff but dancing is way weird for me.

carnivore,"Meals per day/calories and living through work from home, and now going back to the office?","I still haven't started the diet, but I think it will be my only option soon (I was asking some questions yesterday too, I dont plan to ask too many newbie questions, if there is a post with answers to these questions, don't hesitate to link to that post). 

How many meals do you eat per day, and how much meat ($) is it usually? Snacks?

Do you mostly go to butcher's or do supermarkets carry most of the meat you consume?

Since this diet likely started during the pandemic for many, since if I recall well, it was popularized a little before the pandemic by Jordan Peterson (my boy), do you microwave meals at work, or are y 'all fortunate enough to work from home, and cook and eat whenever?

Also, is this entire reddit page for newbies, and answering their questions, or should we start a newbies thread like on some other pages?"

carnivore,I started the carnivore diet 2 days ago and my anxiety is manageable!,"My anxiety  and I was also having  a great deal of stomach pain. I was smoking a lot of pot to not be in pain and anxiety every waking moment. I am doing therapy, on medication, and it did  not make a difference.  In all honesty,  pot only took the edge off.

I had a few cramps after eating today, but so much better! I have just heard how it is unhealthy and not to do it.  But I was at the end of my rope! I am looking  forward to continuing this diet.  

I do have a question,  what, if any, supplements do I need to take? I am glad to be a member! God, in just two days I feel  so much better.  Anyone with anxiety  knows how awful it is. At this point  I will do anything to stop the pain."

carnivore,"Eczema, asthma, and allergies ruin my life, looking for a solution... Luck has helped me temporarily, but I need a permanent solution. JBP's stories have brought me here to see if this diet is can be enjoyable.","  

I have had eczema, asthma, and allergies from very early ages. These diseases are known by pediatricians as a trifecta of immune disorders. It was around second grade that these diseases began to affect my ability to study, participate in physical activities, and communicate with equals on relevant topics. 

I have had very little luck regulating symptoms of these diseases until I tried very potent drugs with equally potent side effects… until I began biologic drugs, I thought strict dieting, or intense side effects were my only options. Unfortunately, the biologic drug I was using was through a clinical trial, which meant a lot of things. If the drug was approved, it would have been free for life, since it wasn’t, I am left looking for alternatives, which has only led to an insurance hell hole, since the competing drug that was approved costs around $40 000 annually.  At this point in time, it may be possible to receive this drug temporarily before my parent’s insurance no longer covers me… which is very soon. This drug has so far proven itself for my eczema, asthma, and also seasonal allergies… not clear about my anaphylactic allergy. 

The carnivore diet seems to deal with Mikheala’s medical symptoms rather well, and since the drug that I was trying for eczema worked for me - with eczema, and was approved for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, I think that the diet that deals with rheumatoid arthritis may be an option to deal with my symptoms. 

I have accepted that it may take a serious attempt to see how this works, but before I attempt it, I want to master some half-decent recipes to see how to cook them properly to be somewhat enjoyable."

carnivore,Dinner,"Every time I talk to a friend and that question causally comes up they act as if I grew two heads. For example I was talking to a friend tonight and we got on the subject about food and I had told her my dinner that night was 11 eggs, 11 oz of steak and some chicken breast. And she had this “wtf” look on her face and asked me “why are you like this” in a joking tone. I wasn’t offended but it got me thinking. Would people be asking me that if I had said I had McDonald’s, or pizza or just chocolate cake for dinner? I don’t think so. It’s gonna be a long time before that stigma goes away."
carnivore,Is rabbit a decent substitute for chicken?,"Long story short, most of the chicken available where I am are hormone pumped, battery hens. Aside from the health of the meat, I have ethical preferences which infer decency to the animals I eat (just had a cow shot, as opposed to slaughterhouse bolted, was sitting in a paddock we'd had it grazing in solo, sniped it, one minute eating grass happily, next minute, it was over before the cow knew it. Good life, from start, until it finished).

I have the access to go shoot rabbit right off a family farm, big fat buggers, right as soon as we mow the grass off the verge to the pines. I'm thinking of stopping buying chicken and instead just going and shooting 20 odd rabbits and deep freezing them.

Has anyone got experience or advice in substituting rabbit meat for chicken? I feel it cooks roughly the same and can be gutted and packaged the same way.

Thank you."

carnivore,Ancestral diet/ bone marrow,"So I hear a lot of uninformed people talking about how eating muscle meat is what our ancestors used to eat but after realizing most wild game is fairly lean and most carnivorous animals actually mainly use protein for energy, I was wondering if humans could subsist off of just eating bone marrow since that is the actual ancestral diet. I’m not discarding carnivore diet as a bad diet, I am just frustrated when influencers like the liver king (pretty sure the foods aren’t carnivore either) try to act like an ancestral diet includes massive amounts of muscle meats (I’ve watched a bit of his clips and I really dislike him)"

carnivore,DIY carnivore,"I've been on a hypercarnivore diet for about 3 months now (about 75-90% animal foods, with some vegetables, mostly fermented). So far the results have been pretty good. I'm down about 35 pounds, which is my primary reason for eating this way. And for the first time in my life I actually feel full and satisfied, which has been amazing.

One thing I've noticed is that this way of eating tends to assume that everyone is buying their meat at commercial grocery stores. There is very little conversation (at least here) about raising your own animals or hunting. I'm a huge proponent of food sovereignty and have been providing most of my plant foods for the past few years through gardening and foraging. As I transition to a more animal based diet, I'm thinking about raising more animals, in addition to egg laying and meat chickens I raise now. I also grew up hunting and continue to do that now. 

Personally, I think having an intimate relationship to your food is just as important as what you choose to eat. So I'm just curious if anyone here takes a more DIY approach to how they get their meat, either through raising animals or hunting them."

carnivore,Beef tallow .,"I've never used tallow neither seen it. Heard it's very good for skin , since the skin loves fat soluble vits . Tallow oil , can it be used as a moisturizer?

Carnivore is very expensive and with that also comes this question.

carnivore,Freezing slices of ribeye roast,"Does anyone have experience doing this? I can get ribeye roast for 10/lb usd at Sam’s club. I usually don’t like to spend so much but I was thinking of buying one, slicing it, and placing each slice in a ziplock sandwich bag or maybe several slices in a bigger freezer bag. 

If I do this, can I season it first and then freeze it? 

Can I put the frozen slices right into an air fryer or should I thaw first? 

Thank you for any advice here."

carnivore,How to prevent insomnia on the carnivore diet,"Hi everyone, I (30F) would like to go back on the carnivore diet. I tried it for 8 days last year and was able to lose 10 lb in that time which have stayed off. I overall felt really well but the only problem was I was struggling with insomnia. I already have a problem falling asleep and I'm worried that if I go back on carnivore, it will make insomnia worse. I'm considering trying the diet again in a few weeks as I would like to lose another 20 pounds and keep it off, but I am afraid that chronic insomnia would make my life miserable even if the rest of the diet is great. Do you have any tips for making this not happen this time around? Since I only was on it for 8 days,  do you think that was an adjustment symptom and eventually my body would get used to it and sleep normally?"

I would appreciate any thoughts on Dairy products, mainly milk, cheeses and yoghurt.

I am doing a little research on carnivore diet and different groups/species that are carnivore. I noticed that cats (specifically referencing house cats and lions), are carnivores. I also looked into this carnivore based tribe in southeastern Sudan called the Murle hunters. 

&amp;#x200B;

Both house cats, lions, and Murle hunters eat a predominantly carnivorous diet. However, I noticed they all enjoy pumpkin.

carnivore,Info about various Pork Rinds,"I've seen some posts here and there about pork rinds and what they're fried in.  A lot are fried in their own fat, or pork lard in general, but some brands use plant-based oils.

I had this idea a while back to make a giant list of ""snack foods"" and what oils they contain.  I started with pork rinds and then gave up after that.  I wouldn't even call the pork rind list finished and certainly not exhaustive of all the pork rinds out there, but it is a decent starting resource.

carnivore,Acid Reflux Advice,"So, I have LPR (larynphangeal reflux), which basically has no cure. I constantly have that feeling of something being stuck in my throat, sore throat, always clearing my throat, and just general throat discomfort right after I eat.

I've been on carnivore for about 3 weeks now, and my body and mind feel amazing, I'm making awesome gains in the gym, and I'm loving how easy it is to keep my calories up. The issue is that techincally with LPR you aren't supposed to have super fatty foods and spices, which is basically all I've been eating the last 3 weeks, and this is probably the worst my LPR has ever been.

I feel like I'm in a catch 22 here, like my body was made to run on this diet nutrition-wise, but it's just about the worst thing I could possibly eat for someone with LPR. Does anyone have any advice for me? Thank you.."

carnivore,Has anyone experienced hair loss on carnivore?,"I was struggling with hair loss for a while but I was taking finasteride pills. No side effects at all. Just finally grew my hair back. You could never tell that I almost went bald. 

Went on a carnivore diet about a month ago and now the crown of my head is literally bold but I did lose 20lbs… 

I saw that others were actually getting better hair on this diet. 

Why would taking a pill and a pro hair diet cause this? I eat tons of red meat and chicken. All grass fed/organic. 

Other than that, I’m in a better mood, sex drive though the roof, gained tons of muscle by working out (it was always easy for me to gain muscle but also fat), I’m happier overall but this damn hair thinning is not letting me enjoy all the gains haha

carnivore,Maybe the D vitamin capsules was the problem?,"I'm almost a year in cv. My main foods are beef, bacon, butter and eggs, but I do variate with fish, iberian pork, and less frequently chicken and cod liver (when I feel like it) and big shrimps and mussels (less in winter). Pretty straight cv, except for an afternoon well-brewed coffee, with a teaspoon of cream.
I hardly get dairy besides that, as I never liked it, except for a bit of melted cheese now and again.
I hardly supplement anymore, and use salt as I need it (it can vary a lot due to weather).
The last month+ I've started to feel a bit 'off balance', sleepy tired, but not in the muscles, and have got an unexplainable pain in my right shoulder/ligaments, like a nerve a bit trapped. I have been feeling great until then. Fabulous!
My first thought was regulating supplements, as I went through something very stressful almost 5 weeks ago (a fire destroyed the apartment next to mine), and it did temporarily change my sleep. But changing magnesium and potasium didn't make any difference. I did need more salt for a while, but I'm back to a, for me, normal level - and a normal good sleep. I've tried to add iodine a week now, to see if it had an effect. Not noticeable.
I then thought 'more fat or more food', incorporated a second 'lighter' meal in the evening, often some fish, a bit of bacon, or chicken with some butter/egg yolk as sauce. The addition of fish seems to do my body good. But didn't change anything...
Going minutely over what I eat, drank and have changed (and hearing something about rancid oil in omega 3 capsules) I realised, that just before the fire, I started to take oil capsules with D vitamin. I stopped taking them 5 days ago and yesterday my shoulder seemed better, and this morning it's even more relaxed. And I'm less tired as well.
Can it just be those capsules??? Maybe they react in the combination with something else... 
My body is very sensitive to weather changes, and the weather has been 'bad' lately, so maybe it's enhanced the bad effect? It's still crazy, so that hasn't changed.
Sorry for the long post, but I'm a bit puzzled. Can one capsul a day make such a havoc in a body?
What do you think?"

carnivore,Carnivore Friendly Specialists?,"My husband has been carnivore for 4 years and he is not getting better. Canivore did cure his pre-diabetes and helped him to lose 80 lbs! We initially thought he had CVS (Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome), and I learned about what a HIDA scan is and how he needed one. He had an ultrasound first and we learned that his liver has jello-y deposits all over it. And his HIDA scan shows something abnormal with his biliary and gallbladder system. Our GP does not know how to interpret the HIDA scan and referred him to gastroenterology. She told my husband to avoid fats and eat only lean meats, lots of fruits and vegetables, blah blah blah (which he's not doing). For whatever reason, after 6 months of waiting, I called gastroenterology and they said his referral was rejected around New Years (and nobody told us). I don't know why he was rejected, but we'll find out from our GP when my husband has his appointment April 5 (takes 4-6 weeks to see her). We're in Canada, in case you're wondering.

I'm in the midst of obtaining the imaging and tests and I would like to do a virtual consult with some sort of carnivore-friendly specialist. One who really understands the biliary system, liver, gastrointestinal system, etc. We'd like to get to the bottom of what's going on, and if there's anything we can do about it."
carnivore,Just getting started,"Hey guys! I’m about to get started on carnivore. I wish I could afford to do this with mostly ribeyes but that’s just not my reality. I’ll be working with mostly ground beef, eggs, and butter/ghee. My picky ass doesn’t like fish, so I wanted to use fish sauce for my omega 3’s. However, I see that Red boat fish sauce does have one gram of sugar. Should I look elsewhere for omega 3s? Just use fish oil pills? I was excited to see initially that fish sauce is fine because I love it, but if that one gram is no good, I’ll let it go. 

Two more questions for you guys:

Is kefir okay? Of course I’m trying to do my research but there’s only so much time in the day to read and watch videos, and I’m trying to get started ASAP. My digestive system isn’t the best and Kefir helps keep things going smoothly. I’d like to keep it if I can. 


I was watching a video where a carnivore said it’s advised to incorporate electrolytes when starting out. She recommended a product (can’t remember the name) but it’s $45/month. Looking for another electrolyte option I can make at home. Please be kind - when I say I can’t afford that additional expenditure, I mean it.

carnivore,What do you guys do to maintain the fat in ground beef when cooking?,"Hi there, I've been doing the carnivore diet for about 2 weeks now. I noticed I feel like absolute trash if I don't get enough fat, and when I do get enough fat I feel great. I'm also currently trying to BULK on this diet at the gym, and I noticed that a HUGE portion of the 70/30 ground beef I cook in the pan ends up melting off the meat into this soup of beef fat... when I looked into this online I read that you can lose like 600 calories and 50% of the fat by draining this, and I want to maintain those calories and fat when I'm eating. Any tips on what to do with this fat other than DRINK it? LOL. Is there a way to cook ground beef without all that fat melting off?

To give an example of how I eat a pound of ground beef, the only way I really know to put it down without getting too full is to take a pound, divide it into 4 giant meatballs, then put mozzarella in it and cook it up like that. My body for some reason has no problem eating 4 meatballs, but a pound of ground beef in a bowl just becomes too unappetizing to finish. What's a way to cook these where the fat won't melt away?"

I’m in my early 20’s and for most of my life I’ve had abdominal pain and the need to go after meals, but nothing this bad or intense and rarely diarrhea. On a few different occasions I’ve noticed what look to me like small gallstones with the diarrhea, however my doctor says they’re just undigested meat (???). I figured things would change after the first 6-12 months, but not much has. Any insight or tips?

carnivore,The Truth about Salt and Electrolytes," Before you respond, be sure to read this entire post.

Salt  and electrolytes are not supposed to be a controversial subject.  This  is a solved issue.  We know the answer to the salt and electrolytes  question.  We've known the answer for decades and even more than a  century.

You do **not**  need to be adding salt to your food or taking any other electrolytes. And if you're trying to manually balance your electrolytes or supplementing, you are very likely only making things worse.   This way of eating is not new and is not based on the theories of some  personality you saw on instagram or youtube.  This way of eating is  based off ""The Fat of the Land.""  That's were we are going to start  looking at information.

&gt;Now  Roxy had heard that white people believe salt is good, and even  necessary for children; so they begin early to add salt to the baby's  food. The white child then would grow up with the same attitude toward  salt that an Eskimo child has toward tobacco. However, said Roxy, since  the Eskimos were mistaken in thinking tobacco so necessary, may it not  be that the white men are equally mistaken about salt? Pursuing the  argument, he concluded that the reason why all Eskimos dislike salted  food, though all white men like it, is not racial but due to custom. You  could, then, break the salt habit with about the same difficulty as the  tobacco habit, and you would suffer no ill result beyond the mental  discomfort of the first few days or weeks.  
Roxy  did not know, but I did as an anthropologist, that in pre-Columbian  times salt was unknown, or the taste of it disliked and the use of it  avoided, through much of North and South America. It may possibly be  true that the carnivorous Eskimos, in whose language the word mamaitok,  meaning ""salty,"" is synonymous with ""evil-tasting,"" disliked salt more  intensely than those Indians who were partly herbivorous. Nevertheless,  it is clear that the salt habit spread more Not By Bread Alone 51  slowly through the New World from the Europeans than the tobacco habit  through Europe from the Americans. Even today there are considerable  areas, for instance in the Amazon basin, where the natives still abhor  salt. Not believing that the races differ in their basic natures, I felt  inclined to agree with Roxy that the practice of salting food is with  us a social inheritance and the belief in its merits, at least to some  extent, a mere part of our folklore.  (50-51)  
&gt;  
&gt;Two  of the main questions about an abrupt change of diet are: How difficult  is it to get used to what you must eat? How hard is it to be deprived  of the things to which you are used and of which you are fond? From the  second angle, I take it to be physiologically significant that we have  found our people, when deprived, to hanker equally for unnecessary  things which have been considered necessities of health, like salt; for  things where a drug addiction is considered to be involved, like  tobacco; and for items of staple food, like bread. In my early northern  days, and indeed until toward the end of my field career, I kept  thinking that salt might be one of the predisposing or activating causes  of scurvy, and therefore did not carry it on long sledge journeys.  (57)

There are some  other quotes, but the end result is that Stefansson did not believe that  salt was necessary and actually felt it was harmful on a carnivore  diet.  He refused to bring it with him.  And, when people transitioned  to a meat-only diet, they did it without salt.  Salt was not used during  the adaptation period.  It was not used after.

If  you're having electrolyte issues, the problem is almost certainly  because you're adding too much salt (or supplementing magnesium or  potassium) and are messing things up.

After Stefansson, The Bear had the biggest influence on this way of eating.

&gt;If  addicted to salt, just like with any other addiction, when you stop  using, you will experience ‘side effects’, such as everything suddenly  seeming tasteless and bland. If you persist, salt becomes vile-tasting,  and food without salt very tasty (but not (sodium-deficient)  veggies-tasteless by nature, but which we are not talking about here).  
It  takes several days for your body to stop dumping salt through the skin  and kidneys and begin conserving it, so when quitting, be aware of your  salt balance- you may experience light headed-ness and the other classic  signs of low sodium, if necessary take a tiny pinch- but try to stop  all salt as quickly as you can tolerate it. Salt was a significant cause  of my grandfather’s demise at 91 from kidney failure. I consider it a  chemical poison. Only vegetarians have a salt-deficiency in their diet.  (54)

&gt;Salt  is a simple chemical, sodium chloride, a mineral substance mined from  where it has been deposited from weathered rocks or pools of seawater.  It can be found contaminated with a wide variety of additional  compounds, depending on the source it is derived from. Some kinds may  also be toxic- as well as unhealthful, as is pure salt in all its forms.  Human commerce in salt began with the use of vegetation as a major item  of human food. Only herbivorous animals will seek out and consume salt-  because sodium is lacking in all terrestrial plant tissues. Carnivores  do not need any salt. Your taste for salt on meat is learned behaviour  only. (59)  
&gt;  
&gt;The  Na and K salt substitution was so that he \[Phinney\] did not have to  wait for the subjects bodies to normalise salt conservation- something  which does not occur rapidly enough for his time schedule. Inuit and  other meat eaters do not use salt of any kind. Neither do I. (233)  
&gt;  
&gt;Salt  is a chemical poison and should not be used. The sodium requirements of  the body are met with less than one ounce of meat/per day. The skin and  kidneys will not secrete salt unless you have an excess in the diet.  The body is very good at conserving it. Salt in the sweat is one of the  most aging things on the skin, and salt increases the stress on the  kidneys. Salt also interferes with the proper metabolism of fats. I have  not taken any salt in 40 years.  (109)

Donaldson  who treated patients for decades with a strict carnivorous diet also  forbid any sort of salt consumption.  You can read Strong Medicine if  you're interested in that.

Maybe  the opinion of these experienced carnivorous eaters means nothing to  you.  Maybe you want to see something more substantial.

&gt;The  animals most likely to experience salt deficiency are herbivorous  mammals. Carnivores acquire sufficient salt from their food. Human  groups that subsist almost exclusively on meat (unless it is boiled) do  not habitually use salt, and in ancient times salt was unknown to such  peoples. It is possible the use of salt by man began when he changed  from being a nomadic hunter to a sedentary agriculturist (cf. Kaunitz  1956).

There are more, but you can find those resources on your own.

The  fact of the matter remains that high sodium and electrolyte concerns is  a fairly new theory that is brought over from keto, and it's fairly new  in keto too because it wasn't that prominent when I did keto over a  decade ago.  And the theory directly contradicts the experience of those  who ate this way for decades.

Where theory disagrees with practice and experience, the theory is to be discarded.

Special  considerations: If you are on a medication that causes electrolyte  issues (like diuretics), you might need to take supplemental  electrolytes, at least until you can get off the medications.  If you  have kidney disease that causes electrolyte issues, you need to work  with your doctor and might never be able to stop manually manipulating  your electrolytes.

If you have  been consuming excessive amounts of salts, gradually decrease over a few  weeks to allow your body to adjust.  Going from a fairly normal amount  to none isn't a big deal, but those people who are drinking salt water  or having teaspoons of salt multiple times a day will need to taper.

Salting  food to taste isn't a huge deal.  I mean, really, it isn't like we're  saying you can never have any salt.  A sprinkle on a steak isn't the end  of the world.   I don't worry about salt when eating out, I just don't  add it to food at home.  Having salt on a steak when eating out hasn't  killed me yet.

Before you respond  to this and quote the ""Salt Fix"" or tell me that you need to drink blood  to get enough sodium, be aware that those responses will just be  deleted and you could be banned if you're obnoxious enough about it.   This isn't a debate.  This is me telling you the way things are.  If you  want to argue that you're not a human, and thus have some sort of  different metabolic needs than experience has shown humans to have,  you'll also be shown the door."
carnivore,What's the healthiest and most nutritious type of meat?,I've read that meat with high fat content is recommended and ground beef seems to be popular here. Can I eat just that or should I have some variety? Are all types of meat equally good?
carnivore,How often should I eat liver?,"I know people generally say you should avoid eating liver daily due to just how rich in nutrients it is and how that can lead to toxic amounts in the body. My myfitnesspal app says that one piece of sliced liver is 280% above my recommend amount of daily intake of vitamin A.

I know that most B vitamins have a very long half life, is it the same with vitamin A? So like if I eat liver once or twice a week, that leftover vitamin A from 3 days prior will sort of carry over into the others so there’s no need to have more of it?

Liver is my only source of vitamin A in this diet. I know cod liver oil exists and you can take that daily, but for reasons I don’t really have an explanation for I kind of want to stick purely to beef and other ruminant animals."

I’ve lost 5kg which is fine I didn’t really need to lose or put on anything.

I was feeling adventurous at the time (also won a $100 bet to eat a bowl of these…haha).   Of course, I was expecting to end up in a hospital that night given this is not technically carnivore or even omnivore?.  I’m not sure if we evolved to handle insects in our stomachs.  But to my surprise, I didn’t end up with tummy pains or gas or anything bad.   So I guess my question to you guys is:   what place does consuming insects have (if any) to a human diet?  I understand they have high protein but low fat.   What about toxins or anti nutrients? Not saying I’m gonna eat grasshoppers again, unless someone were to bet me another $100. 😅    Just curious.

I'm about two weeks into my carnivore, I'm looking to make it through March and beginning in April start reintroducing various foods. My current plan is one food a week, I was wondering if, based on yall's experience, that's too fast?   


I'm going to start with garlic, then ginger so I'll have some minor seasoning options and then go into various veggies.   


Honestly I'm at my lowest point mentally with the diet right now and I'm just day dreaming about reintroduction. I started this because of constant digestive pain and have only seen minor improvements so far. Right now I'm doing ruminant and fish.   


Long term I'm thinking about making it a yearly ritual though depending on how it goes. Without much to go off of, I feel like transitioning into it every year after Thanksgiving could be a good idea, and then to come out of it at the end of January. I don't know if anyone else out there practices it that way?  


Anyway, Thanks for any and all advice!"

Has anyone else gone through this experience? It just seems so different from what I was told to expect. 

Fwiw I lift 3 mornings per week and do conditioning two morning per week.

carnivore,Didn’t notice when the butcher handed me the meat he cut.,"So I we t to the grocery store, just I usually do, to get some meat. The usual butcher wasn’t there so I asked the guy that was there for a beef loin sliced into 1/2” thick cuts. Save all of the fat trimmings. He confirms that I want it cut 1/2” thick. I say yes sir. He takes it over to the counter and I start looking at the rest of the meat selection. One more time, he says “You wanted 1/2 inch cuts right?” And I say again, “Yes sir 1/2 inch please.” A little while later he comes back with a styrofoam meat tub wrapped up in cling wrap. The steaks were arranged  flat side up so thickness wasn’t noticed immediately. I get home and open the package to separate into more convenient zip bags. That’s when I notice that the guy had absolutely no idea how thick 12” is. Lol I don’t mind cutting but wow he was way off.

carnivore,Carnivores that frequently exercise + salt,"Hi all,

I know that salt is a bit of a debated topic in the carnivore community. From what I know, most of the science says that more salt is fine, your body can just deal with it, so better to be safe than sorry. But I've also seen plenty of carnivores talk about how salt seemed to have negative effects on them. What I haven't really seen is anyone specifically mention that they frequently exercise. So are there any carnivores out there that exercise often as well as don't add salt? Or at least experimented with it? What are your experiences?  
I keep getting stricter and stricter, trying to eliminate the causes of things that I react to (I just said goodbye to pork and even ghee about 2 weeks ago), and recently I've been wondering about salt. I'm actually about five days into the experiment, and here are some observations:

1. I haven't been sleeping well for a long time, this is due to many reasons known and unknown though
2. Because I can't sleep, I've been skipping workouts or just working out lightly. So far my lack of salt doesn't seem to affect anything whenever I do exercise though. I feel fine, just as fit as before
3. I drink way less water than before. I'm just not as thirsty, and water is just more quenching, I guess. It tasted so good with added salt, now without it it tastes a bit weird, if I'm thirsty then water tastes good and if not then I can't drink any more than a small sip. Is this perhaps a biological advantage? Not needing to drink as much water and still performing? 
4. After about 3 days, suddenly beef tastes salty to me. Like, legit, it suddenly almost doesn't taste any differently at all. If I feel slightly like craving salt I just eat a little beef and it goes away. Eggs could still use salt in my opinion, but I don't miss salt on my food (except for dry salt brine which is the best way to prepare steaks imo)
5. On carnivore my body odor is much less, but still there. Now suddenly it's like I don't have body odor. And my bowel movements don't smell as much either
6. I feel like I need to eat more frequently (perhaps body adjusting to sudden lack of salt), so my energy is a bit up and down, but whenever I do eat, I feel great for a while (setting aside lack of sleep)
7. I suddenly dropped about 1.5lb after day 2.

Overall, it does feel like maybe I was having some issues due to added salt, but the adaption is not easy, especially since I'm so sleep deprived. I'm honestly slightly worried about this experiment being dangerous since there's so much info out there about salt and performance and all that stuff. But I just finished working out as I type this, and it was a great workout, I feel loose, limber, clean, not sore at all despite lifting heavy and finishing with a run. Thoughts?"
carnivore,Help me like pork rinds!,"I love the idea of pork rinds. Crispy pig skin. I don’t mind the taste. Really, it’s good. But, as I eat them, it’s as if someone has placed a vacuum in my mouth and sucked out all of the moisture and saliva. They are so drying to the mouth. Once you chew, it’s like eating sawdust. 

What do you do to your pork rinds to make them appetizing? I think at this point dropping them into some melted butter would be best.

Currently I believe I am having problems with a large and unbalanced insulin response on my high protein diet. The keratosis pilaris on my thighs is as bad or worse than ever, and about an hour after eating I start to feel very tired and lethargic, similar to after a big meal of carbs. I'm worried that my new diet is actually going to lead me towards pre diabetes. I have read that in people with pre-existing insulin issues that the insulin-glucagon balance might be out of order on a high protein diet and that the insulin response can be as high or even higher than with high carb diets.

carnivore,Deodorant?,"Hey all, pretty new to trying the carnivore diet, but enjoying the weight loss and more importantly how I am feeling better in some other ways. I (31/M) basically started doing it since Feb 27, 2022, with a pretty standard or worse diet right before.

This may be an unusual question, but what is your deodorant situation like?

I have heard some people report smelling less (body odour, breath, and fart/poop wise) after some time on a carnivore diet. I don’t think my body odour has changed much yet, but I am not that far in. I realized today that the deodorant I have been using (Jason brand) has aloe vera and other plant products/extract. It is sold as a pure natural deodorant stick. I have had minor-medium redness in my armpits for months, which I believe changes depending on the type of deodorant I use. Not sure if it’s an allergy to one or more ingredients or what. Been using it because it doesn’t really physically bother me (that I can tell). No itching necessarily. No bumps, just red, like the skin is irritated by something.

Has anyone found they need less or no deodorant after doing carnivore for a while? Or has anyone found a more natural way to deodorize their body odour… perhaps with an animal product lol.

carnivore,Sticking to carnivore diet while in a hotel St Louis MO,"Hi all! I know it’s a long shot, but can anyone recommend delivery services or restaurants that deliver cooked, grass fed beef in (Bridgetown) St Louis? I’m in training for two weeks (arriving tomorrow) and staying in a hotel with no kitchen amenities. I do have the option of buying an air fryer and sourcing beef but would rather concentrate on the study and not take up time cooking. If I do go that route, any recommendations on where I can buy good quality and reasonably priced beef? Thanks in advance!"
carnivore,Cheapest meats?,"Wondering what the cheapest types of meat (any animal protein) I can buy. 

Seems to be 

eggs $2-3/dozen

tuna (canned) $1.69-$2.29/can

chicken legs $1.50-$2.00/lb

Anything else? 

(note: these are regular prices. Sometimes other/better meats are on sale, for ex rack of ribs for $2/lb, or pork shoulder for $0.99/lb and I try to snatch it up when I see it)"
carnivore,How much meat do you guys eat a day?,"I’m a week in and I’ve been eating 3lbs of ground beef a day and the past three days I’ve been hungry even after the third pound, and I would just eat more, but the problem is that’s a lot of extra money a month to move up to 4 lbs a day"
carnivore,60 days in and fatty liver is cured,"Around 6 months ago I did a blood test and my ALT(SGPT) was 78mg/dL (healthy level is below 45) I also did sonography (not sure what the test was called) and doctor confirmed I have a level 1 fatty liver. After doing carnivore for around 2 months, my blood test now shows that my ALT is 22mg/DL which means I no longer have a fatty liver. Blood sugar is 81 mg/dL and my kidney functions (eGFR &gt; 120) are very good.  
I literally cured my ‘fatty’ live by eating fats lmaoo, this diet is a real miracle. 
Now I know why doctors freak out when you tell them you only eat meat, it’s because they will go out of business if everyone follows this diet. They obviously have been brainwashed by their education."

carnivore,Cooking Questions Re; Ghee/Lard,"I'm new to Carnivore. I see that everyone recommends Ghee and lard to cook. I also see a lot of folks using ground beef, which doesn't seem fattening enough. 

Are ya'll just melting the ghee/lard in with the ground beef when you're cooking it or do you melt it on top after it's cooked? 

When you're making meatballs, how are you getting those fattening enough to do you some good?

what about with leaner cuts of steak? do you just avoid those entirely or are you using the lard/ghee to fatten it up? 

I also love chicken but there's just no fat there so I'm not sure how that would work. 

I guess I'm just looking for specifics for how you guys are using the ghee/lard to increase the fat content of the leaner cuts of meat that you're eating. 

Thanks!"

carnivore,Has anyone taken Ancestral Supplements Beef Liver Capsules?,"I am taking 2 capsules and this is my second day. I see a handful of reviews from people on Amazon speaking of horrible stomach pain and even almost bleeding to death.

I am taking as I want to feel better and get rid of fatigue and insomnia to name a few things. I eat meat, specifically beef and chicken.

I figured this was the Gold Standard since a few redditors recommended it to me and I trust them. I do, however, want to ask true carnivores that have tried this:

carnivore,Severe OCD and trying to plan a carnivore lifestyle as a newbie,"I want to eliminate all of the shit out of my diet and take a carnivore approach. I just have no clue on how to cut out the shit yet still cover my nutritional bases. Currently eating at around a 300kcal surplus and while gym progress is steady, I really don’t feel good in myself. 

Could anyone point me to some reading material or share your experiences with an average day of eating? Eggs and butter are already a staple but I want to cut out sugar and stuff like oats, breads and other processed stuff. 

My shopping list contains: 
Beef stock for broth
Full fat natural yogurt
Steaks
Ground beef
Chicken
Cheese
Eggs
Natural salts
What could I add? 

Ideally I’d like to hit around the 3000 calorie mark and covering all bases 

My understanding is to take a month with just meat and water to then start introducing more. How’s my body going to react being cut from carbs? 

Many thanks"
carnivore,Nutritional Information for Wild Game?,"Where do you find nutrition information for something like Himalayian Tahr?

carnivore,Definitely seems like there’s a conspiracy to subdue meat consumption around the world,"Commented on an r/environment post detailing how 1 in 10 Americans are vegetarians. The study had a small sample size. There’s no way 10% of Americans are vegetarian. People started talking about impossible burgers and how tasty, nutritious, and good for the environment they are. I mentioned that I’ve been on a pretty strict carnivore diet and was downvoted into oblivion. Listened to episode 1784 of JRE where he had a nutritionist/dietician and biochemist on and they explained how the fake meat is not good for you. They use rancid seed oils which can cause major inflammation and they use synthesized chemicals as a substitute for the vitamins and protein. I want to hear some of your thoughts on this because I believe meat is the key to our health."

carnivore,Upset stomach,"I’m about three days into strict carnivore, only eating 3lbs of grass fed ground beef, tallow, salt, and water. Last night and today my stomach felt a little queazy, could this just be the adjustment phase? Or am I not agreeing with something?"
carnivore,Does this beef liver look normal?,"I’m just wondering if this lighter brown-ish skin on top of the liver here is normal. 

I got this liver about 3 months ago from a local grass fed/finished farm and it’s been frozen ever since.

None of the previous packages had this brown film but the last two I’ve opened do have it.

Does anybody know what it is? Is it ok to eat? I can’t find anything about it anywhere.

carnivore,How to actually calculate the calories of the meat we are eating?,"I'm looking at cronometer results, the same meat amount, from different locations, different parts, different fat content have 2x varied calories. 

[https://imgur.com/iolVBZ9](https://imgur.com/iolVBZ9)

&amp;#x200B;

Also just eat until you're full isn't a practical advice. I want to be able to cook exactly the amount that will/should satisfy me. I don't want to have too little and then having to cook another steak. Or have to store away the rest of my steak because it was too much."
carnivore,I’m really loving steak and eggs for breakfast.,I got a beef loin sliced up at the store yesterday so have tons of ribeyes. Steak and two eggs in the cast iron skillet with butter and salt is an awesome way to start the day.
carnivore,Abdomen cramps,I’ve been in the ER for 2 hours waiting to see a doctor. I’ve been on carnivore for 3 months. While I was at work today I was bent over for about 1-2 minutes and started to get aggressive cramping; think of a Charlie horse but in my upper left abdomen. Through my shift whenever I bent down that would happen and would last for a few minutes each time. When I’m not bent over it’s just a lingering ache. I don’t really think it’s carnivore related but the nurses had asked me about my last bawl movement. I think that the nurses think that I’m constipated and I know for sure that’s not the case. I’ve been constipated before and it didn’t feel like this. Has anyone had anything similar happen? How do you deal with the stigma of your diet in a medical setting( I didn’t mention my diet but I feel like it’s going to come up).

carnivore,Had my eyesight tested ...,"I'm in my late 50's. Since my mid 40's, my eyesight had been doing the common thing of shifting into needed progressively stronger +ve prescription glasses.

Last tested in 2017, my right eye was +2.5, left eye was +2.0.

After the last two years of fairly strict carnivore diet, I had to go back to get new glasses because the old ones were obviously wrong now.

The new test on Saturday, showed my right eye as +0.5, and left eye as -0.5.

The optometrist seemed quite surprised.

Has anyone else experienced this?"
carnivore,"What would you spend $$ on, BESIDES meat, that would make your Carnivore journey easier?","So I've a small amount of unexpected $$ burning a hole in my pocket, and I thought it'd be nice for once to treat myself to something that will help facilitate my Carnivore journey.  First off I purchased a decent knife --  I was cutting up some pork and realized I needed one, badly, but I wonder what else, if ya'll had some unexpected $$, you might purchase to help yourself along the Carnivore journey -- besides MEAT or anything to eat.   ??  Anyone?  Yes, I know it's just as simple as EatMeat, but sometimes it's nice to do/have something that would make the journey easy or fun or more enjoyable or more convenient.

carnivore,TRUE OR FALSE: You shed body fat faster if you eat leaner meats.,"Assuming you have the fat in you body to lose, say 20%+

Eating a diet of 80/20 fat to protein provides plenty of fat = no need to pull as much from body ?

Eating a diet of 50/50 fat to protein provides less fat = need to pull more fat out of body ?

Can sustained but short introductions of lean meats be used as a strategy ? 

OR, at the pro level, would a bodybuilder do lean meats for 3 weeks to get the 'shredded' look ?"

Unlike most here, I plan on counting my macros, initially keeping a 65/35 split to retain strength as I cut weight.

I need about 3,000 calories per day and found a perfect split by just eating ground beef, eggs, and bacon. If this is my main food for most days, will I be severely lacking in anything? I plan to get liver to incorporate every now and then too."

carnivore,How are you all getting your potassium and magnesium?,"I'm thinking about this, but not sure where to get it. I'm eating mostly beef, eggs, bacon and chicken liver."
carnivore,PSA: Salt is absolute shit for your skin,"No I have confirmed it. After stopping salt before Christmas and then relapsing heavily (not only on salt) during the holidays I have worked hard to get on the carnivore track for three weeks now.  


My weight is normalizing again (not much belly fat though) and generally I feel great. Only thing is my eczema on the face that just would not let up. What I ate: Ground Beef, Eggs, salt ""to taste"" (which was in my case on the rather heavy side but not extreme).  


Well guess what. After someone else posted that his posriasis only resolved after stopping salt (after already a year on carnivore) I also had renewed resolve and strength to do it.  
It took only THREE days to see such a massive improvement in my skin, it is insane.  


If you do everything ""right"" and your skin (or potentially other inflammatory problems) just will not get better: Don't listen to all the curious advice of how you absolutely need electrolytes and should salt and then eat potassium and whatever. Just leave it out for a few days and maybe see a difference.  


I am aware of the importance of electrolytes. But I'm pretty sure the human body just requires about 500mg - 700mg sodium a day (which is to be found in meat by nature)."
carnivore,HOW TO EAT MORE MEAT?!?!?!,"I'm 6 foot 1.5 or 186 cm, and 210lbs or 96kg. I'm not fat, but not shredded, kinda like got a flat stomach but no abs and quite strong. Hard to say what my LBM or BF% is, but I look healthy...

I'm going to the gym everyday, lifting heavy and got plenty of energy because of carnivore diet.

I've been doing carnivore since the start of the year, which is also when I started going to the gym again and stuff after a long break.

&amp;#x200B;

I should be able to eat 3+ lbs of meat a day easily right? 

But noooo! After eating like 2 lbs of meat it is literally impossible for me to put anything else into my mouth. At some point after 2 lbs of meat, I just kind of stare at the meat, take one bite, then stare at the meat again for a few minutes before the next bite, and eventually I just end up throwing like half the steak away or whatever...

&amp;#x200B;

I heard that on carnivore we should eat until full which I'm doing. But I wanna gain weight and strength and stuff, but how will that be possible if I can't eat enough? Before carnivore I was doing OMAD, and I started carnivore on OMAD too, but when I noticed I couldn't eat enough I switched to eating just ""whenever hungry"", which has lead to 2MAD, but that didn't really help, still not eating much more...

&amp;#x200B;

Actually the only thing I seem to be able to eat forever on carnivore seems to be dairy and cheese, but IDK if I should do that because IDK if im lactose intolerant or not or if that'll just turn to fat or whatever."

carnivore,I can't stomach anything but beef,"Chicken is unsatisfying and leaves me feeling empty; I can't do it more than twice a week.  Pork is bland and dull.  Seafood is too light and ephemeral.

But beef?  Man, there have been periods where I've done carnivore for a year, and I enjoyed beef as much the last day as I did the first.  It makes me feel full and satisfied on a very deep level that is hard to describe.

Why is this?  Is there a biological, evolutionary reason why beef is so satisfying?

I can’t seem to consume more than 500-700g beef, lamb or fish which is half of my calories. I just get nauseous. I can consume chicken without a problem and easily eat 1kg of chicken.

I’ll be honest I’ve never even visited the butcher counter TBH. Seems intimidating. I see them back there but I’ve seen them be super rude to customers and they always act like they don’t want to be back there. So I just grab what I need out of the package section and get out of there lol.

carnivore,Zinc Problem,"Hello everyone,

So for the last 2 ish years I’ve had a problem with tolerating zinc. It first happened when I took a zinc supplement, then when I atr some oysters, then when I ate too many pumpkin seeds, etc etc etc. I would be kicked into a state of restless insomnia at night where my brain was racing to no end. I would “sleep” but essentially get zero rest. It got bad enough to where it affected school and work. On days where I consumed too much zinc, I would have very dark circles around my eyes from the lack of rest. However, going carnivor for the last week I can eat 3lbs of meat (which would have a zinc content way over what ive been tolerating) and have been sleeping amazing and feeling much more clear headed. Would anybody have any ideas as to whats going on?

Thank you for your time"

carnivore,Weak legs?,I am on day 6 of standard carnivore and had something weird just happen to me.  I was walking out of the bathroom and my legs just basically gave out.  Not like having weak legs from walking too much or exercising but my knees felt numb and my calves felt like they were floating but weighed a ton.

carnivore,how sustainable would be to just eat pemmican for month or three?,"just read that pemmican could be eaten for years because there is everything that body needs.  been doing carnivore on and off for three years and as i am coming/still have from bad emotional eating disorder i can keep it for a bit but depressed mind and life struggles keep knocking me off the bath and take me always weeks to get back. i noticed though the less selection i have the easier it is.  where i live i cant even remotely afford ribeyes and even ground beef is a stretch at the moment.  but i found i can buy suet and meat scraps and make some pemmican. thinking to do just omad - gonna swallow my days worth calories and that would be it.  i’d wish to drink just water but i am in the cold climate and  drinking teas.  
salt - the texts i read said that mist likely they didn’t add salt to it but no one really knows. same with berries. they added some 5% berries but some think only because the europeans who bought asked for it. 
so i am thinking to just sprinkle salt on top of it for taste. would that be sustainable ?"

carnivore,Kombucha on carnivore diet? - Help with anxiety,"Hey guys,

I'm on my third day of becoming a carnivore and I am loving the satiety mostly; I'm not hungry one bit. 

The main reason I'm eating this way is because I want to restore my guy health. I've suffered from digestive issue and inconsistent stool for as long as I remember. Anxiety has also affected me for a long time and I've noticed when I take care and eat ""healthier"" my anxiety is lessened. I'm pretty sure it all stems from poor gut health. Kombucha has been really good at helping me with my gut health and restoring me back to ""normal"" many times in the past if I've gone out drinking or eaten a whole bunch of crap.

For the most part I'm consuming exclusively fatty red meat and a couple of soft boiled on the side, seasoned only with salt. I do often get the urge for a refreshing kombucha (low sugar option). I love kombucha. I'm wondering do you guys think it's a bad idea to have a low sugar kombucha a day?"

2. I have been using liquid IV electrolyte  mix daily. I have low blood volume and blood pools in my legs because of POTS. So I would like to use some sort of electrolyte mix. I have ordered lmnt and waterboy to try out. Anyone have any other suggestions?

Thank you so much for your help!"
carnivore,chicken broth - nectar of the Gods,"Yooooooooo, I made homemade chicken broth today.  NOT bone broth.  Just regular chicken broth.  I put a whole chicken (chopped into parts), skin and bones and all, into a big pot of water and simmered for 40 minutes.  Took the breasts out so that meat would stay nice and tender and not get too rubbery.  Continued to simmer for another 40 mins.  Then I took all of the chicken out. 

I stripped the chicken of the skin and pulled the meat off the bones and chopped it up and put it in a bag.  I put the broth in 2 separate large containers in my fridge.  You could see the fat rise to the top when it cooled.  Most online recipes say you should skim the fat at this point, but of course, like any good carny, I was like, 'why would I do that?'

I had 3 meals (only) today (so far), which consisted solely of chicken and 2.5 cups of broth each time.  The broth is so delicious and nourishing I have felt full for hours.  I could drink it straight.  It is rich and golden and you can see how oily it is.

QUESTION:  DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY CALORIES I SHOULD ATTRIBUTE TO THIS BROTH?

Many store-bought broths are ""fat free"" and high in sodium.  Many online sources for homemade chicken broth calorie macros list equal amounts of protein and fat and still call for skimming the fat.  I don't know why it should have any protein in it.  It seems to me that it is all fat.  Fatty water, with flavor."
carnivore,A huge benefit in my first week of carnivore!,"For the last 2.5 years I have been taking PPIs (proto pump inhibitors)  namely omeprazole, for my GERD.

I have not experienced one ounce of heartburn and it has made me so happy! I never would have thought that I would be able to stop taking a medication that was a by-product of my terrible eating so quickly. If you're on PPIs and are eating this diet you might just be able to stop taking your pills.

carnivore,I'm not hungry anymore after eating meat?!,"I'm sorry, this is not a high-value post, but I just needed to share how fascinated I am.

I've been a vegetarian in some way or another my entire life, and after way too many years of poor health stumbled upon carnivore and decided to give it a try. I'm not eating 100% carnivore yet, but adding more and more carnivore meals and phasing non-carnivore meals away.

Anyway, the most startling thing I've noticed so far is:

When I'm eating other things, I just eat and eat and eat forever and no amount of trash is ever enough.

When I eat a carnivore meal, I eat 'til I'm satiated, and then that's it. No more hunger. When I'm done, I'm done, and I don't need to eat anymore for hours and hours.

This is nuts. Feels so foreign to me!

Also today I had rare meat for the first time ever and why did not one tell me this was so good? It's so soft and delicious OMG 🥺"

That wasn't enough, because two hours later I took another hour nap. This is awful.

So, I’m curious..

 I noticed after about a month of having a carnivore diet that I wasn't sleep walking anymore! a couple times a month I'll have a binge on some berries or apples and every time I do, I have really bad sleep walking episodes that carry on several hours of the night.

 has anyone else experienced this? I'm curious as to what could be causing this to happen when I have sugars. my theory is the rise and fall of blood sugar/insulin causes me to seek more sugar as I do very often eat while I sleep walk. regardless, this is another positive of this lifestyle that makes me want to continue it.

I am a long-covid survivor who has turned to the carnivore diet for the past 6 months. This diet has done wonders for me, but I am still struggling with my weight. Obviously it comes down to eating more (duh) but long-haul has fucked with my hunger hormones and made me almost scared of eating. 

I am 6'2"" and hovering around 145 lbs. At my lowest point I was 138 and was very weak. I have returned to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu 4-5 times a week so the exercise helps me eat but also increases my metabolism. 

I know getting proper calorie intake is vital for growth but I can't seem to stomach enough food since I feel relatively full. Ironic considering how overweight I was in my teens.

carnivore,Eggs causing inflammation for folks?,"Today I bought a weeks worth of food for carnivore. 

Goals are weight loss and reduced inflammation. 

Having too much Joint Pain and I have had cognitive decline and some auto immune issues. 

My question is regarding eggs. I love them. Eggs are how we know God loved our paleolithic ancestors.  However, I hear a lot of people say that eggs are very inflammatory. 

So, should I eliminate everything non carnivore and see if that solves the problem or should I initially start with just meat and eliminate eggs from day 1?

For what it’s worth, I have never noticed any issue with eggs. The foods that I know are a huge problem for me are:

Dairy -causes horrible sinus congestion
Soy -wrecks my gut and causes joint pain
Beer -wrecks stomach for days (and has wrecked my wallet for years). 
Sugar -joint pain and energy gone. 

I tend to have depression, my sleep is poor, and I have never been able to wake easily (Jordan Peterson said this changed for him on carnivore).

carnivore,How to eat raw liver,"Hi all,

Wanted to share my strategy for eating raw liver for those who are not keen on the taste, should any here decide they want to experiment with that. 

First of all, you want to have sourced quality liver and have it frozen for 2 weeks as extra precaution. I then semi-thaw the liver and cut it into manageable strips and partially-refreeze those. Cold temperatures on the tongue reduce our ability to taste, so you want the liver to be partially frozen but have some give (can bend it). Breath in through the nose and out the mouth as you chew a couple times and wash down with water. 

I get almost 0 liver taste this way, thought I'd share."
carnivore,I took antibiotics and now I'm rekt.,"Today is my 25th day of me doing carnivore. Since I did this diet everything was great, no cravings, no hunger, no insomnia, no sleepy feelings during the day.

Unfortunately on 20th day, my left testicle felt uncomfortable. So what I did was I just deal with it without doing any checkup. So, on 23rd day, the pain was growing and I decided to finally do a checkup and the doctor told me that I have epididymo-orchitis which is an infection at my balls and he gave me antibiotics.

I took the pills and suddenly after one day, my cravings and hunger came back. I also felt really sleepy during the day, I slept from 3pm-5.30 pm and I haven't felt this way since I started carnivore. My theory is that the antibiotics have messed up my carnivore gut microbiome."

carnivore,Protein in Dried Meat: Pemmican,"Howdy folks, 

Ex-infantry, long time fan of efficient eating and the carnivore diet for a healthy and strong lifestyle. 

Recently, I've gotten into making pemmican, and am slowly switching to an almost entirely pemmican diet--just need to up my dehydrating game a bit, since right now, my dehydrator is small so I end up having to make just enough pemmican on a daily basis. 

I'm exercising pretty hard, which means I need at least 1g of protein per lb of lean mass (2g/kg), so I'm consuming about 800g of dried beef per day, on the assumption that there is somewhere between 20-25g of protein per 100g, and then I just add enough tallow, at 900 calories/100g to make up the caloric difference.  

It may seem like a silly question, but--there is no protein ""lost"" in the dehydrating process, right? The reason that I ask is because I see certain beef products, jerky, etc, advertising 15g of protein per 100g, but I don't get how that can be, when virtually all beef cuts containing *at least* 20g protein per 100g of meat.  

Once I'm all set up and stocked up, I'll try 1 month of pemmican only and report back my results.  

Cheers,

carnivore,I'm a student and cured my IBS (and others) through carnivore and smart supplementation,"It took me a very long time, but through research and exploring the infinite resources available to us, I was able to figure out my gut problems, which was the source of IBS symptoms, food allergies and a gut-brain type depression with anxiety and brainfog.

carnivore,why won't people shut up about calories,"These past few months have been all about eating to hunger and not counting a single thing. No shit it's scary, given that EVERYONE constantly keep talking about the calories they burned or the amount they're eating and ""oh but you won't lose if you eat more than 1200 calories"" like NO I don't want to eat 1200 calories, in fact I don't even know how much I eat. I don't want to count I don't want to spend hours freaking out or planning or mentally calculating.

Yesterday someone commented on how much I eat and said if I ate more than 1200 I would start to put on weight, and it just reintroduced all those doubts and anxieties in my head all over again. As if it wasn't difficult enough to let them go in the start. I'm still not willing to count, I don't want to and I wanna stick to eating how much ever i am hungry for, but people really piss me off sometimes."

I tried this combo today with shredded cheese and plenty of salt as my first carni meal and it was really good!

carnivore,does anyone else have a reaction to slow cooker meats?," Hey everyone. I'm fairly new to carnivore and have mainly doing it to try and minimize my ibs symptoms and so far overall I've been seeing pretty good results. One thing I noticed however is that the two times I've eaten meat from my slow cooker I've definitely noticed a pretty substantial reaction. The first time I made a brisket and some shortrib with just some salt pepper and garlic powder. It tasted great but a few hours after eating it my stomach was super upset to the point where I felt like vomiting. I figured maybe it was the garlic powder but had a hard time believing it because I've never had issues with garlic (or pepper for that matter). I decided to slow cook a pork shank and some pork ribs I got from my local supermarket and this time I only seasoned it with salt and pepper, and I had a similar reaction. Not as bad but definitely signs of inflammation and bloating and just feeling bogged down. I eat bacon almost every day and feel fine so I don't think I'm having a reaction to the pork itself. Has anyone else had a similar experience? I can't think of any reason why I'd react this way to things specifically cooked in the slow cooker other than maybe the way it's cooked does something to the meat."

carnivore,"Smart Bacon for a Stupid Society - my review of vegan faux food ""smart bacon""","  

I was recently at the grocery store when I saw a cardboard box titled ‘Smart bacon’. *How odd,* thought I, immediately sensing some bullshit. No one cares if their bacon is ‘smart’ unless they are a pretentious prick. Why wouldn’t it be called ‘delicious bacon’? 

The other reason my bullshit detector pinged was because, as I said, it was in a carboard box. You couldn’t actually see the bacon. What are they hiding? Thirdly, it was stupidly expensive for such a small box.

A lame carboard box of overpriced crap, sanctimoniously calling itself “Smart”?

Smells like vegans.

Of course, I was correct, but I was still giving them too much credit. Here I thought it would be made out of beans or lentils or some shit, with maybe some turmeric for coloring. 

How wrong was I. Leave it to vegans to turn something like bacon into a disgusting abomination Frankenfood that I wouldn’t even feed to a politician. The only thing smart about this fake food is the fact that someone is making money selling this cheap garbage and tricking people into buying it.

Here is what is in this smart bacon: (If you work for smart bacon, slap yourself and then congratulate me for exercising my right to free speech, and then slap yourself again.)

Water, soy protein isolate, vital wheat gluten, soybean oil, soy protein concentrate, textured wheat gluten, less than 2% of: salt, sugar, carrageenan, natural flavor (from plant sources), autolyzed yeast extract, natural smoke flavor, spices, fermented rice flour, oleoresin paprika (color), potassium chloride.

They should have just called it “turd bacon” and sold it as a pig fattener, because that’s what it is.

This crap bacon is actually a wheat gluten and soybean oil granola bar, with some smoke flavour and coloring so you don’t puke the second it nears your face. It deserves a more thorough deconstructing. 

Let’s go through the main ingredients of ‘stupid bacon’ to remove any lingering doubt that it belongs absolutely nowhere except in the trash.

**Wheat gluten**

Unless you live under a rock, you have probably heard of gluten and gluten free diets. Maybe your one of the people who thinks it’s a bunch of bull, or maybe you strictly follow a gluten free diet yourself. So, what does the actual, non-funded by cereal company, scientific studies say?

In short, it turns out that wheat gluten is indeed terrible for you, even if you don’t have celiac disease. In a study titled “[The Dietary intake of Wheat and Other Cereal Grains and Their Role in Inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3705319/)” the authors write: 

“Although government-supported dietary guidelines in Europe and the U.S.A advise individuals to eat adequate amounts of (whole) grain products per day, cereal grains contain “anti-nutrients,” such as wheat gluten and wheat lectin, that in humans can elicit dysfunction and disease. In this review we discuss evidence from *in vitro*, *in vivo* and human intervention studies that describe how the consumption of wheat, but also other cereal grains, can contribute to the manifestation of chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases by increasing intestinal permeability and initiating a pro-inflammatory immune response.”

Oh boy. Gluten is garbage. Want more evidence? Sure thing. In another scientific paper titled “[Adverse effects of gluten ingestion and advantages of gluten withdrawal in nonceliac autoimmune disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29202198/)” the authors state the following: 

“Multiple detrimental aspects of gluten affect human health, including gluten-dependent digestive and extradigestive manifestations mediated by potentially immunological or toxic reactions that induce gastrointestinal inadequacy. Gluten affects the microbiome and increases intestinal permeability. It boosts oxidative stress and affects epigenetic behavior. It is also immunogenic, cytotoxic, and proinflammatory. Gluten intake increases apoptosis and decreases cell viability and differentiation.”

Wheeeew.

Considering 98% of trash bacon is water, gluten and soy, lets now move on to the soy, especially the soybean oil. 

Soybean oil is walking hand in hand with wheat gluten to deliver a 1-2 punch combo of inflammation and disease. Being literally one of the worst things you can consume that’s legally allowed in food, soybean oil has been [linked to tons of super fun things](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/01/200117080827.htm) like obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, [dementia](https://scienceblog.com/513550/soybean-oil-tied-to-obesity-neurological-problems-study/), anxiety and depression. 

Its also [extremely](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132672) ‘obesogenic’ and ‘diabetogenic’ which are slightly more scientific ways of saying it makes you fat and causes diabetes. There is much [evidence](https://themasclinic.com/negative-effects-of-soy-on-men/) that soy proteins can also cause hormone disruption in men, by mimicking estrogen. Soy is known as a phytoestrogen, or a plant estrogen.

If you’re wondering why people would possibly think this ‘smart bacon’ is even remotely healthy, you are not the only one.

The only reason overpriced garbage like this smart bacon can be sold as food is because of the extreme amount of propaganda and brainwashing occurring, trying to convince people that meat is unhealthy and bad for the environment. 

Nothing could be further from the truth. Human beings are meant to consume meat, as we have for hundreds of thousands of generations through our evolution. Meat consumption and its concentrated, highly bioavailable energy and nourishment allowed our big, hunting brains to thrive and grow. 

If you are concerned about your health and the environment, ensure your meat is from the best possible sources. Search in your area for local farms. Buy from companies that don’t use hormones or antibiotics, and where the animals are allowed to roam. Search for heritage pork. 

A well sourced, local and clean slab of Berkshire bacon from a happy, natural animal that was quickly and humanely slaughtered for your nourishment, as is the cycle of life, is the real “Smart bacon”. Not the processed wheat gluten and soybean oil carboard fake bar masquerading as food on the shelf. 

Eat real food. Be happy. Keep being beautiful carnivores.

Until next time,

carnivore,Any advice or solutions for my sister?,"Info of her and issues:
- She breastfeeds
- Has psoriasis that came back but now is itchy and inflamed red.
-Itchy on her c section area on the inside.
-Lots of bloating from smallest of eating
-Gallbladder removed years ago.
-She goes gym often.
-Snores and sleep apnea
So she doesn't do carnivore but she's now considering it, but I feel she's not as experienced as I am and I don't want her to face lots of stress as she breastfeeds my nephew still. He will not take formula at all. 

I was thinking beef and eggs, with grass fed butter for a month but I'm not as knowledgeable. Personally I cleared my psoriasis but I'm a guy and she has other issues I cant relate to. I assume it's a gut issue, typical for us psoriasis folk, but I'd love any of your recommendations based on her circumstances. I don't have knowledge for a woman tbh.

carnivore,Rendering Hamburger Fat,"Hello,

I've been on carnivore for about 2 years now, but I'm just starting to render my own fat. Since we eat a lot of hamburger, the obvious choice is to take the leftover hamburger fat, strain it, and store it. For whatever reason though, it keeps going rancid on me.

Here's my process, hopefully someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong.

&gt;Boil mason jars to kill all bacteria, let them dry out.  
&gt;  
&gt;Take liquid beef fat from hamburger, run it through cheesecloth to remove any leftover meaty bits.  
&gt;  
&gt;Seal jar and turn it over to let fats rise to the top  
&gt;  
&gt;Drain off any excess/non-fat liquids left over.  
&gt;  
&gt;Store in cool, dry place in sealed mason jar

The fat/tallow has been going bad in just a day or two by using this process, and I can't think of why. The only thing that I can see that might be an issue would be if some liquid managed to get trapped in the jar, but I've been pretty thorough about removing it all. Can anyone point me to what I might be doing wrong?"

carnivore,Bah-humbug…..,Watching a newborn liter of puppies for some friends while they’re away for Christmas. I live several miles up the mountain and we had a major snow fall last night. I often get snowed in at my place. So just before dark I decided I’d stay at their place just in case so I could make sure the puppies and mama were taken care of. Of course I brought a couple nice steaks along. My friend isn’t carni but is an accomplished cook who owned a bbq cart for years. Didn’t even consider bringing salt as I thought for sure he’d have plenty. Well fuck me……not a sodium chloride crystal to be found in the house. So here I sit with an almost 2 pound ribeye and not a grain of salt to throw at it. Would be real risky to try and make it home with the roads as bad as they are today. The closest market may be feasible but is a solid 45 min drive if they’re open. And those roads aren’t exactly clear either. Better than the trek back home but still a bit risky. This is worse than a lump of coal. Regardless I hope all you fine folks are having a lovely holiday season!!

carnivore,Beef &amp; Tallow - What's the next most tolerated fat?,"Hi - It's my third time doing carnivore. It's going great! Ive stuck with beef &amp; tallow this time. My body loves it! Problem? I dont love, love tallow. I find it tolerable because of the way it makes me feel.

Any suggestions for the next most tolerated fat? I used to gorge myself on butter. Im only now realizing it wasn't doing me any favors. I never felt this good on it.

I've never felt this way before! Im reluctant to add anything that will cause problems. Any suggestions for an easy transition to an additional fat source?"

It's especially difficult to function at work at a super high level on the bad days.

carnivore,was anyone here not much of a fan of meat (didn't enjoy eating it much) before the diet but found it helpful for health problems (not related to weight)?,"I would do this diet in a heartbeat despite not much liking meat if it were to help me significantly health-wise. However, through years of paying attention to my diet I am pretty good I believe at recognising what is a bad dopamine-fuelled craving feeling e.g. craving bread, and what it feels like to have your body communicate it's nutritional needs to you via desire/aversion to foods. I eat meat but can't eat much of it before not wanting to eat anymore and I'm altogether not a huge fan. Wondering whether anyone on here felt similarly but has found the diet helpful, specifically in terms of non-weight related health issues?"

I have noticed when doing TMAD (never intentionally just busy or something comes up and i have to skip lunch) i have digestive issues. The reason in bring up TMAD is because yesterday was one of those days, then i ate salmon, a big steak, beef crackling, and some bone marrow. my gut started to feel off and then i woke up in the night cold and literally dripping with sweat. Then ive had diarrhea all morning. thoughts?

EDIT: Last night was the first time i cooked bone marrow. I had the oven at 450 and left them in there for 20 minutes probably closer to 22 or 23 mins.

carnivore,MY AMENORRHEA FINALLY REVERSED AFTER 2 YEARS I AM CRYING,"i can't even i'm genuinely crying this is worth all the weight gain. Literally just an hour ago I was freaking out about eating too much and feeling unusually hungry AND THEN THIS HAPPENS. Funny how anorexia can still manage to wiggle into my head and whisper shit BUT NOPE NOT HAPPENING.

this by no means is a reason to eat less or do any sort of restrictive behaviour just because I am now ""healed"", I will continue to eat whenever I feel hungry and eat as much as I want to feel satisfied. 

I know one thing for sure, I will NEVER restrict food EVER EVER again. I don't care how much i weigh, I have already wasted 2 years of my teens on this nonsense, wrecked my metabolism, stalled some growth, messed up my hormones, NEVER AGAIN, NOT WORTH THE SKINNY JEANS."

carnivore,Chuck Roast lovers questions,"Hi, I find that chuck roast is the best cut of beef for my general needs. It’s in the $5/lb range and I generally cannot afford ribeye or anything like that. Chuck has a lot of fat content which is great. I usually buy from Sam’s Club.  I’ve noticed that some pieces are tender and cook very easily. (I cook mine like a steak, I don’t roast it for hours) And some pieces are tougher and don’t make as good an experience. Is there a way to tell when you’re buying them which pieces will be the good ones? It seems to be hit or miss. It’s either luxurious or tough. Thanks for any chuck roast advice."
carnivore,Am I allergic?,"Whenever I eat liver or take beef liver pills, I always end up getting a metallic taste in my mouth hours after consumption (not during consumption). Usually it's a bad sign for your kidneys or liver.

Like, let's say I take just the beef liver pills. I have a strong metallic taste after 1-2 hours. Is that normal or should I just keep taking it? One time I took the recommended amount and it made me have muscle spasms (6 pills, I know I am an idiot). I stopped for like a week and then took only one and I still have metallic taste.

I started eating frozen liver in bites and after 1-3 hours I always end up with a metallic taste in my mouth. I can't tell if this is normal or not."
carnivore,Homemade tallow question,So I work at outback steakhouse and I got a cook to save me a bunch of the fatty ends of prime rib and I want to know if I can render those down into homemade tallow. the edges have seasoning on it so should I try to wash the seasoning off first or can I render it down and then when I strain be fine? Or will the seasoning flavor it and make it taste off?
carnivore,Meat is too gamy,"I do this for autoimmune issues and have been meat, salt/seasoning, and water only for a little over 3 weeks. I've done this before with regular grain fed beef and this time I'm doing grass fed. I bought a side of a cow and it's working out pretty well for me.

Except for the gaminess. I can't get used to the gaminess. It's particularly noticeable in some pieces of fat, which I'm not getting enough of. My appetite is basically nonexistent and I'm struggling to eat. As a result, I decided to allow myself seasonings. I've added in some cumin and chilli powder, as well as some shawarma seasoning. This hasn't really helped.

I'm daydreaming about cheese and dairy and cold cuts from the store. I want to feel the burst of energy that I know I can get from eating this way. I also made a commitment to myself to just eat only this beef until it ran out and I don't want to break it. I feel stuck. Any suggestions for making this beef more palatable?"
carnivore,How do you stick to your diet with kids around?,I have an almost 1 year old and I really want to get back to a mostly carnivore diet after doing an elimination period. It made such a huge difference for me and is even how I got pregnant. The problem is I find it really hard when sitting and eating with my little one. First off the temptation for other foods is worse. Second if she sees me eating the one thing she wants it and will mostly ignore her food. She doesn't seem to have food sensitivities and I want her to have a fairly rounded diet. It's there a trick I haven't thought of.

carnivore,Why is rare meat preferred over fully cooked meat?,"Hi fellow carnivores!
Not sure if this has been answered before but couldn’t find anything.

Since starting carnivore, I had been under the impression from the community, from various different sources I have seen, that having a steak cooked on the rarer side was healthier and better. 

Recently I came across an interesting video about human evolution and that cooking meat is what allowed us to get more nutrients from the meat and hence evolve bigger brains and become the smart humans we are today. 

So my question is, should I be cooking my meat more to the well done side of the spectrum to get the most nutrients? 

Thank you in advance for your kind replies."
carnivore,Has anyone found a cure for the nausea?,"I’m 7 days in of ground beef and salt. Nausea is the worst in the mornings like pretty much I’m on the verge of throwing up for hours. I’ve done a more relaxed version of carnivore in the past where I also ate pork (bacon etc), chicken and cheese and this did not happen. I salt my beef lightly and also drink 1/4 tsp of Redmond’s and 1/4 tsp of no salt (potassium) in 8oz of water twice a day. 

Do I just let the nausea take its course and will it go away? I don’t feel like eating at all today and I could barely finish a pound of ground beef yesterday. 

Any suggestions?"

carnivore,how much deep frying damages the nutrients in meats and offal?,"found some super cheap salmon soup-base from the market. 
basically it is just the spines and the last bit meat on it and some skin. 
the original idea was to make broth but then out of whim decided to fry them to see what comes out. so i fryid them in some duckfat and butter and eventully enough fat came out of them that they were half submerged in oil. fryed them until brown and extra cripsy.  tasted amazing and the best part was i didnt have to take any bones out - the whole thing was nice and crunch and easy to eat. didnt even needed salt. 
so basically i just ate 10 spines with small bones. 

so my question is as the bones have a lot of calcium what the deep frying does to it? 

and as i am broke as fuck atm i saw lot of other cheap offal and skins and such hits and ends on market that could be make tasty by deep frying.  also seems easy way to get more fat in."

carnivore,I prefer bison over cow,"I find bison to be much better tasting than cow. It's more tender, looks more appealing- dark red meat and has stricter standards.

carnivore,If you miss stuffing this Thanksgiving...,"...Consider the Stuffin Muffin. This is not the strictest Carnivore recipe, because the flavor we associate with stuffing is mostly sage and onion, but I don't mind some flavor on holidays, especially when the only other thing I'm eating is turkey and more turkey.

- 30g crushed pork rinds (4505 Lightly Salted taste best to me)
- 1.5 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 eggs
- 1 tablespoon fresh or dried poultry herbs (Natural Grocers Poultry Blend, or any sage-based blend)
- ~1/2 cup cooked breakfast sausage (I use 4 links of Applegate pork breakfast sausage, diced up)
- Optional diced onion

Crumble and brown the sausage (with onion, if you're into that), and set aside. Mix your pork rind panko with the baking powder and your herbs (or just sage), then toss with the sausage pieces. Whisk in eggs, and divide in 10-12 mini or 6 large silicone muffin cups. I prefer the mini size, for more surface area. Bake ~20 minutes at 350F, remove from silicone cups to cool for 5 minutes, and enjoy destroying your muffins by shredding them to bits. The resulting bowl of muffin bits will both look and taste an awful lot like Stove Top stuffing."

Beef/water/salt/egg yolks

So. 

Nothing groundbreaking. Everything is going really fantastically. IBD is gone. Like. Just gone. 

Stool hasn't stabilized, but with autoimmune I don't suspect it will for a bit and it doesn't bother me at all considering my background. 

Celiac is obviously not an issue. 

I *did* trial without eggs and added salt for awhile, no noticable difference. 

My weight seems to have stabilized around 130 pounds, ~ 20% BF I think? Which is fine, I'm not worried about it, I just wanna be healthy. 

Had a cholesterol scare, read it could take time for blood to stabilize anyways, so I'm listening to my body right now. I feel good, my HR is fine, so I'm not worried. 

Unfortunately the fibro (which also may be a neurological disorder?) Hasn't gotten better - it varies day by day. I can walk now, so I walk a couple of miles everyday. It's clearly improving. But I 100% still have flares. They've nothing to do with me eating, so I've been focusing on my actual skeleton. I'm on gabapentin which helps loads, hoping to wean off in the future.

carnivore,Overate beef tallow,"So, I have pork lard to fry stuff, but it does not taste good and apparently it is not 100% natural, unlike the package claims, because it is stored under ambient temp and it's hard and bright. I went asking around all markets and butcher shops in my neighborhood for beef tallow but no one had it, and yesterday someone at one of these places suggested to ask at a place where they sell whole chickens and ribs on Saturday and Sunday only. I asked the guy what they did to the tallow that ended up on the bottom of the grill, and he said that someone would collect it to make soap, but he gave it all to me. For some reason, I overindulged on it and I can't tell if some of the spices could stick to the tallow to make me crave it or should I blame myself for having such an appetite?

Now I do love cooking, a lot, and I enjoy most veggies. So I have been down simply due to not being able to express myself through cooking. Carnivore is mostly out of necessity due to my living conditions.

carnivore,One week in!,"Thanks for all of that support and suggestions the last time😬❤️ I did just go all-in and I don't know if it's the placebo effect or the actual diet or a bit of both but yeah I do feel so much better.

Firstly I haven't had to take meds for anxiety/sleep in the last two days, which is such a relief because I hated being dependent on them. Secondly I'm eating a lot more, and I feel more alert and functional. Not cold anymore either, yay!

The next is the weight gain. I know I shouldn't see it as a negative thing, but my previous mindset makes it difficult. It's not much, just enough to make my jeans slightly tighter. Surprising how quickly I've held on to that extra fat, especially on the lower abdomen and hips. It makes sense because that's where the reproductive organs are? And I need my period back so I'm just gonna get through this. 

Another thing I've noticed is that I'm so sleepy these days. Which is funny, considering I was taking meds for sleep. I suppose it's the adapting or its the healing /recovery, or it's both I don't know, I'm just making a lot of assumptions. 

All in all, weight gain is scary I hate it but I also love eating as much as I want to satisfy me and not be hungry all the time! 

I do have slight restrictive thoughts from time to time, for example, to cut back on the fat and eat more protein. Then I have to have this mental conversation about how important fats are to regulate my hormones, especially my sex hormones and how essential it is for recovery. So yeah, as much as I was tempted to throw away all of that rendered fat from the beef, I didn't, I used it to make scrambled eggs later because I was still hungry lol😂"

carnivore,Concerns of an exclusive seafood diet?,"While I'm not adverse to land animals, I'm a giant seafood lover and would happily make fish and shellfish exclusive meats for this diet. I wonder if there are specific concerns with this instead of including land flesh?

I read that actor Jeremy Piven had to be hospitalized with high mercury after a 3-year diet of sushi only, so I take it all-seafood shouldn't last long and have more diversity in long term.

I'm also assuming that many prep methods such as traditional deep frying are out since they require plant or nut flour?"

carnivore,Why do I keep stopping?,"It's the same story every time.

I'm going good for a couple of weeks or months. I get confident that I'm feeling better. All symptoms and issues have subsided.

So what do I decide to do? How about a piece of cake? Or chocolate? Or pasta? Or potato?

And then we end up back in sinusitis-ville. population: Me. Quality of life: Horrendous."
carnivore,"hi, I'm not on the carnivore diet, but why do I feel AMAZING when I just eat bacon?","Serious question!

I'm pretty thin, 5'9"", 135lbs, low body fat.

I basically eat a lot, a normal decent diet, rice, meat, butter, low sugar, no alcohol, predominately water.

Some days if I feel like it, I'll just eat bacon for my first meal of the day.  12 ounces of it.  When I do this, I feel FUCKING AMAZING.  Energy, enthusiasm, glee, just like, feeling fucking phenomenal.

Why?"

carnivore,Confused: low in magnesium?,"Daily RDA for magneesium is **400-420 mg** for men and **310-320 mg** for women.

500 grams or 1 pound of beef has about **100 mg.**

Sure, i've never heard of a carnivore deficient in anything, as meat has ALL nutrients humans need.

But what's the explanation behind seemingly low magneesium in comparison to RDA?"
carnivore,Best prices for grass fed beef in Southern California?,Hey all right now our family subsists mainly on ground beef @ $3/lb in Southern California (near Riverside). Anyone know where we can find grass fed beef (ground or not) at something close to that price? I'm happy to buy a mini freezer and buy in bulk if that helps. Is it even possible to get grass fed beef at sub $3.5/lb any recommendations and deals would be super helpful thank you.
carnivore,3 weeks into carnivore and cheated once...intense cramps and bloating,"Hey everyone, this is my first post here. I have been doing strict carnivore for the past 3 weeks after being on keto for a while. doing the diet to see if it will heal some neuropathic pain (saw a study on pubmed regarding ketogenic diets and neuropathic pain). 

It was going super well BUT then i cheated with 1 little buddha spiked peach ice tea...then a second...then a third...then a fourth, you know how it goes (all in the same night which was this past sunday). All was fine monday but i woke up tuesday with insane stomach cramps and bloating which have persisted into today. I thought i might be needing more fat after eating a large steak and still feeling hungry so i desperately shovelled 4 table spoons of peanut butter down...im sure that was another great idea. anyway looking for some relief as i have a huge paper due this weekend and my gut hurts so bad its hard to focus on anything"

carnivore,"I started adding eggs to beef, pork and salmon. And i love it!","I used to eat 500 grams / 1 pound of meat (usually beef) a day. It was wonderful at first, but after a year i started to consume less and less meat. Today i am down to 300 grams / 0.6 pounds a day.

One day i added eggs to my steak. 1-2 months flew by, and i noticed i've kept doing that. I can't explain it, but there is something so satisfying eating eggs and meat (or salmon) on the same plate. It seems this is my new carnivore diet approach that i found accidentally."
carnivore,No Hunger and not feeling full,"I kinda lost my hunger nor can I feel really full. 
I already made my own thoughts on this and came to the conclusion that my hunger hormones are very messed up from my past with undereating and binge eating. And I only felt full when my stomach hurt alot . I guess I have to relearn what my body really wants. 
Anybody else have similar experience?"
carnivore,Grain is grass seed. Grain fed is grass fed.,"It occurred to me this morning that grain is the seeds from one kind of grass or another.  Grass is not just grass.  There are many kinds and varieties of grass.  

I live in wheat farming country, and have worked shocking wheat for cattle food.   That makes grain eating cattle into ""grass fed.""    Just saying."

Starting up again, but really not keen on fighting carb withdrawals my whole life. I know I should just man up, I feel better without carbs, but the mental battle is exhausting.

Are there any of you who eat a lot of (carnivore carbs) and still feel benefits? 

Anyone stay out of ketosis on this diet?

Sorry if this is a dumb question; new to the topic"

carnivore,Nearly Freezing A Roast For Slicing Into Steaks,"I've been getting NY strip roasts for the past few months and have recently been hypothesizing that they would probably be easier to hand slice into steaks if they were a bit more firm. I know that there are a bunch of variables here, but I'm interested in suggestions about how long to put a roast in the freezer to firm it up for slicing. What I'm normally working with is about a 10-12 lb. roast and an average top-freezer refrigerator. 

Thanks!"

I’m done, I’m done with all foods for now except for beef. 

I was hoping someone out there with severe LPR or GERD like myself had found success, and what’s the correct way to do this? I don’t mind spending the extra money On good steaks etc, I don’t like how ground beef tastes &amp; at the moment it triggers the HELL out of my reflux symptoms in the worst way.

carnivore,This proves it,"I can't drink milk.

I tried normal milk, and tonight I bought lactose free milk thinking I was intolerant. BOTH cause almost instant severe bloating. (This is 4 days into carnivore). Cheese and butter haven't had any noticeable negative effects.

This really sucks. I love milk, and steak, so this diet was heaven sent. It's still good I guess.

The last thing I have to try is heavy cream, though if lactose wasn't the problem, something tells me that wont work either."
carnivore,Is my current way of doing the carnivore diet safe long term?,"I've recently started doing a strict carnivore diet, beef, salt and water only, to try and help with my gut problems (suspected SIBO/SIFO, currently testing for it) and inflammation issues such as brain fog. I'm currently 2 weeks into this diet, I'm exclusively eating ribeye steak at the moment, which I put iodized salt on when cooking, approximately 2,5 liters of water daily and I take an electrolytes supplement.

I'm just wondering how long eating only ribeye is sustainable, am I risking depleting nutrients or electrolytes if I do it for too long? My current plan is to stay on this for at least 2 months."
carnivore,Histamine reaction,So I was eating at a friends house they made me chicken and eggs but they used plant based oil I forgot to bring mine. It was all good but in the evening I had itchy skin in my face like I always had my histamine reaction in the past. Is this because of the plant oil? I also may think I also react to eggs.
carnivore,Does freezer burn lose nutritional value??,I bought some meat few months back and it's starting to show freezer burn. Does this lose any value in the nutrition? What are good ways to prevent it if possible. I don't own a vacuum seal machine but open to hear any alternatives.
carnivore,Heart rate reserve (HRR) training,"Does the heart rate training is the same on the carnivore diet :

* Zone 1 (60-70% of your HRR)

* Zone 3 (81-93% of HHR)
* Zone 4 (94-100% of HHR)
* Zone 5 (98-100% of HHR)

Maybe the zone 1 and 2 can be higher and zone 4 and 5 lower even if the resting and max HR are the same (compared to a ""standard"" diet)."
carnivore,"""You don't need organ meats""","I'll take the extra vitamins and minerals, thank you very much. They probably help you heal faster too. It's hard to get too many antioxidants and minerals on this diet. If you don't care to reduce aging even more, that is fine by me"
carnivore,Reading resources?,"What's the best book on how to do the carnivore diet as opposed to why? I'm a reader and like lots of information before I start something. A simple explanation of just eat meat and eggs doesn't satisfy my curiosity. Eventually, I'd like to add more foods and eliminate what doesn't agree with me. Thanks in advance for any answers!"
carnivore,Beef fat trimmings!,I got roughly 3 lbs of trimmings from a local butcher and I’m so excited! I just don’t know exactly what to do now.

carnivore,Lunch meat?,"Looking for some advice. I started a new job over the summer and don’t have access to a microwave during lunch time. I’ve been eating Kirkland roast beef, salami and cheese for lunch almost everyday. My concern is if lunch meat is healthy? I remember hearing that lunch meat usually has preservatives in it. Also, any food suggestions? In general I don’t like eating cold steak or cold burgers which was my go-to when I worked in an office with a microwave. Thanks."
carnivore,"Protein grams per kilogram, I must be doing this wrong.","So I've read all the protein recommendations, anywhere from one to two grams of protein per kilogram of ""desired"" weight. 

If I want to weigh 200 lbs then at 2.2 kg/lb I would target 200*2.2=440g/28g=~15 ounces of protein per day! I'm 30 days in and eating an average of 3 lbs of meat per day. living on one pound of meat per day would just make me hungry.

I will definitely check that they are cut next time!!"
carnivore,Fat content,"Hi, new here, everyone says fat fat fat from what I can tell. I went and bought 10 lbs of chuck steak, butter and liver. My question is, is the fat in the chucks enough fat?

carnivore,"Feeling like I can easily eat over 3 pounds of meat per day, excessive?","I started the carnivore diet about 3 months ago and I feel great so far. I've not been counting my calories, the only thing I count is how much the meat weights in the package when bought. From time to time I do count how much meat I eat and it's mostly around 3 pounds and most of the time over it. I do feel full after eating 3 pounds of meat. Yesterday I restricted myself to 2 pounds and I was hungry. My concern is that 3 pounds is excessive. I didn't know how many calories I was eating until I look it up 2-3 weeks ago. I did  not lose that much weight since I started working out again but I did lose a bunch of fat and I do look leaner. I am still concerned that I might be over eating but I do feel great and I am losing fat (for now)"
carnivore,Reaction to fatty trimmings,"I've tried eating some beef fatty trimmings a few times and get a weird reaction; I feel really tired and awful and my face flushes like crazy. The skins around my eyes goes bright red like I'm having an allergic reaction.

Mast-cell reaction? Autoimmunity? 

I dont think its histamine as they're really fresh.

carnivore,Can taking probiotic suplements solve my diarrhea problem?,"I tried carnivore last winter for three weeks. My biggest problem was diarrhea that had no warnings like all of a sudden if I'm not on a toilet seat in like 30 seconds I'm done.

I'm planning on going carnivore again next week but I have places to be and the diarrhea might be a real problem. Would taking probiotics for the first weak or two solve my problems? Or would it inervene with my body adapting to the diet. Thanks!!"

carnivore,Flash Food - Great Way to Make Carnivore Affordable,"If you are looking for a way to save money on your meat, dairy, and other carnivore foods, give FlashFood app a try. (My mom told me about it a few weeks ago and I've already saved $100+ on meat)

Basically the FlashFood company/app partners with grocery stores to help them sell their soon to be expiring foods. Naturally, meat and cheese and milk is a big part of this. You just download the app and check the stores around you each day (or several times per day, if you get crazy about it). When you see meat that you want, you buy it on the app. then go to the store and they have a big silver refrigerator up in front of the store. You just go grab the items you bought, swing by the customer service counter and tell them you are picking up your order, and you are on your way. 

The food usually expires anywhere from 1-4 days after the time they list it for sale in the app so make sure you either cook it or freeze it pretty quick after buying. 

All food listed in the flash foods app must be a minimum of 50% off of the normal price, so you get big savings. I just picked up 8 stakes (I think it was 6 New York strips and 2 Ribeyes) and the total was only like $50. In my area they have brats, pork loin, lamb, and other delicious meat all the time

I do not know if this is available everywhere. I am in West Michigan and they have it active at Meijer and Family Fair (two large chains in the midwest). Anyway, given the fact that many people have a problem with the price of going carnivore, this can really help. It helped me anyway. 

To start, just go to your Apple/Android app store and search for the ""Flashfood"" (all one word) app. The log is a purple background with a white circle and a green leaf. it is free to join and use as much as you want. 

IF you feel like it, you can enter my referral code (MICH36XRD) and we each get $5 once you spend $10. (Mods, if this is not permitted, please just delete this last paragraph. I don't really care much about the referral money, this service really is great and can help a lot of people."

carnivore,Study says that there is no evidence that grass fed beef is healthier than grain fed,"I eat grain fed beef, and was wondering exactly what I was missing by not eating grass fed. According to a study by researchers in the Department of Animal Science at Texas A&amp;M University, the answer is:

""...there is no scientific evidence to support the claims that ground beef from grass-fed cattle is a healthier alternative to ground beef from conventionally raised, grain-fed cattle.""

Regarding cholesterol, CVD, and type II diabetes, the study found:

""Neither ground beef type increased LDL-cholesterol...

An excellent study from Texas Tech University demonstrated that there is no difference in cholesterol in ground beef from grass-fed and grain-fed cattle if the fat content is similar.

Neither type of ground beef had negative effects on risk factors for CVD or type II diabetes, but the ground beef from the grain-fed cattle provided more positive health benefits by increasing HDL-cholesterol.""


The above information came from an article by Stephen B. Smith, Ph.D. Regents Professor, Department of Animal Science, which can be found on this site:

carnivore,Is it harmful to eat unmelted animal fat?,I cook a lot in advance and I really can't be bothered to reheat stuff when I'm in the middle of a busy workday so I usually just chow down some meat I cooked beforehand.

carnivore,Supplement's and Elektrolyt,"So I had massive headache, nausea and also had to vomit in the last days. Now its very stable I took my salt, magnesium and potassium but do I always have to take them extra or just  the salt? Will my body get enough magnesium and potassium from meat now?

carnivore,I have a bottle of Cod Liver Oil Capsules: Should I take them?,"A while ago, I (39F) bought some ""Nordic Naturals"" Cod Liver Oil Capsules (for reasons I cant remember - might be because I was into Morley Robbins for 30 seconds at one stage.)  

[https://therahealth.com.au/product/arctic-cod-liver-oil-soft-gels/](https://therahealth.com.au/product/arctic-cod-liver-oil-soft-gels/) 

I never took it. I guess I am suspicious about freshness of these oils, and the whole PUFA factor. 

**Quick poll: If you had this lying around (been in the fridge the whole time), would you take it?**  I know views are a bit divided on fish oils etc.  Curious what the consensus is out there, and idk if I trust the Supplements sub. 

It seems like such a waste - *BUT -* I also have no objective trashing them if its not going to do me any favors."
carnivore,Chronometer and Jerky,"(Not related but kind of related….I found what seems to be a solid place to order beef liver crisps rather than CA [Jojo’s Jerky Carnivore Crisps] thanks to all the recommendations on my last post!!)

Ok now my question, I’ve been using Chronometer for a while to track all my macros and micros and love it. But as I was playing around with the idea of adding liver jerky to my existing diet I noticed Chronometer factors in the overall protein but not the amino acids of the jerky. Then experimented and found that it doesn’t seem to factor AA for any jerkys. Am I missing something about jerky and amino acids or am I just expecting too much from Chronometer? It typically has amino acid breakdowns on all other foods I enter so I the jerky part confuses me."

I’m just not the best at budgeting, so any tips? I’ve seen that roast are often much cheaper than the steaks they come from, but is there anything specific I should look for if I want to cut the roasts into steaks myself? For example; my local Raley’s sells sirloin roast and cross rib roasts for $6.99/lb, and they’re usually pretty uniform in shape, so would I be able to easily cut them up?

The latter part is pretty self-explanatory. I see lots of different estimates. 5’7, 158lb male looking to lose weight, gym+basketball practice a few days a week and about 3.5mi/day average."

I don’t think the majority of them were eating copious amounts of salmon and I know ruminants eating their natural diet have a better ratio, but still nowhere near 1:1. I also wonder how important this is, I think limiting omega 6 and man made trans fats are more important.

carnivore,"not a problem post, just curious - is anyone like never hungry?","I'm not particularly worried about it, honestly. I'm like, definitely undereating, but I'm listening to my body. I'm already thin so it's kinda worrying. Every now and then I'll just toss back some eggs to make sure I won't die of presumed starvation, but I genuinely feel really great. 

Is it normal to not be hungry? Anyone else had this? Maybe it's because meat is better utilized. I'll eat like half a ribeye, some eggs...and them like twelve hours later some more eggs...aaaand I'm done. I don't feel bad, so I'm not worried. 

It just blew my mind. My mind isn't on food all the time, and I'm just kinda vibing. Just thought it was cool. Lol."
carnivore,Chicken Marrow,"I have only just discovered the Oven/grill setting on my microwave oven and have been experimenting with it a lot.  I am normally a big fan of the cast iron grill skillet, but my bacon and steaks come out so beautiful that I think I'll be doing this for a while.  I cooked whole chicken legs on a large circular glass dish last night and the flesh and skin was amazing.  This morning I cleaned the dish, and found that I was left with translucent chicken 'jelly' (jello for the yanks).  

Is this marrow tasty?  The cat didn't want it.  Is it nutritious to eat, and safe to do so without further alteration?  

I pay a lot extra for the 'happy' chickens from France that get to run around outside eating bugs and breathing fresh air, if that makes a difference."

carnivore,Looking for a bulk meat supplier,"Up until the last month I had been using Wild Fork Foods to load up on $5/lb Ribeye, $3.5/lb eye of round (for jerky), and $4.5/lb chuck roasts. It was fantastic, and I have no complaints other than them occasionally running out, or not having enough available. Now though, they've doubled the price of the ribeye ($11/lb), and the cheap eye of round hasn't been available for days. I get the economic situation, I really do, but I just can't eat ribeye 5 nights a week at $11 a pop. I'm getting to the bottom of my stash, and needing to find a new source. So my question is, does anyone know of a US meat delivery service for ribeye or rib roasts? I can buy 30-40lbs at a time if the price per pound is right. I've thought about trying to contact my local Costco, but I can't imagine they will come down on price too much (if at all)."

Is it possible to only eat chicken, fish and duck eggs (all organic of course)? Or is red meat 100% a requirement. I am just not sure I can get myself to eat red meat yet. I am also lactose intolerant so how would I deal with the butter aspect of this diet?

Are you allowed to eat any veggies at all???"

carnivore,Falling off the meat wagon and trying to find a way back on,"Greetings ladies and gents,

My journey began in 2020, after a couple years of knowing about the carnivore diet from Dr.Baker and Jordan Peterson I decided to start this way of eating to lose weight, eliminate certain ailments, and get healthier in general. Between January 2020 and March of 2021 I had managed to lose about 35 kg, toning my body up in the last 4 months or so by starting bodyweight training. Since then, certain aspects of my life have taken priority and in chasing financial success I found myself neglecting my training and, with time, letting loose on my diet. A cheat day every couple weeks turned into one every three days and before I knew it I was eating fried chicken and donuts every day. I have since gained all the weight back and then some, even experiencing the very same ailments I was glad to be rid of. I need to ask; has anyone had this experience? How do you recover from this re-addiction to carbs and sugar? How do you respond to criticism that, like other restrictive diets, carnivore dieteers will end up gaining all the weight back, like I have? How do I start going carnivore again and do it with the full conviction that I had, in a way in which I don't look back at all the things I crave? I think, to an extent or on some level, I'm kind of sick of meat after eating it non stop for months, how do I regain that ability to focus on animal proteins only and at what point should I consider that this diet may not be for me?

Sorry for the many questions, I am just desperate for help as I feel like I have fallen from grace. I've struggled with my weight for years and after finally feeling being in the best shape ever, frustration over my slowing progress, laziness, and outside (and inside) pressures to cheat here and there eventually got the better of me. 

I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and respond."
carnivore,To the people that were or are customers of Butcher Box,"What was your fail draw with them. What was it that made you end your subscription? 

Mine is I got sick of emailing every month complaining how bad quality their meat is. They keep packaging old meat to sell it off as high quality fresh meat, in reality it’s far from that. Also very bad cuts of ribeyes. They have gave me so much credit over the past six months. I’m done emailing, I just emailed them to cancel my subscription. I’m done with them! 

What are your stories with them?"
carnivore,Bone broth question,"I keep a bag in my freezer and throw bones in there as we finish a meal or whatever. Then when I have enough, I make broth. My question is, is it a problem if some of the bones have breading on them from the fried chicken? I’ve always had whole roasters and never saved bones from fried chicken before so I wasn’t sure. 

My guess would be perhaps the little bits of breading may just boil off and then get strained out with the solids. Does that sound about right?"
carnivore,More protein = wider eating window or more meals?,"Anyone out there who increased their protein (up to 1.6g/kg to 2g/kg) also needed to widen their eating window or spread out the protein over 3 meals instead of two/one?

I am wondering if collagen peptides, of any animal, are suitable for the diet no matter what you're hoping to get out of it. Is there anyone who has experienced bad reactions to collagen peptides or found it was an obstruction to them reaching any of their goals with this WOE? And if so, was it collagen from a particular animal or brand or collagen type?

This does NOT happen when I eat regular high-fat or high-protein meals of any kind. 

I usually feel like having ice-cream or drinking some tea or some other shit. Quite strong cravings for various other foods.

carnivore,What are your recommendations for vitamin supplements and probiotics?,"Hey carnivores, I'm a 28 year old healthy male who has gone through carnivore for a total of 4 months in the last 2 years. I went into it the first few times looking to battle some lesser auto immune diseases and found that I really enjoy how I feel on carnivore and how simple it is. Over the course of my attempts (4 months with 1 month at a time) I would regularly see my doctor and do blood tests. While over all everything looked good, there were some diminished vitamin levels with an overall higher collosteral than before. Each attempt I've tried to tighten things up a bit (better quality meat and introducing organ meat) and found that over all things look much much better now. 

I am starting a 5 bout on carnivore now and was curious as to what kind of vitamin supplements you all take and what your experience has been with vitamin levels. 

Secondly I'm curious about your thoughts on probiotics and introducing them to a carnivore diet. This round I am going to be introducing kefir to my diet, but what other ways are there to bring in probiotics?

Thank you!"
carnivore,Well it’s been fun for the last month. Guess this diet isn’t for me.,"I started carnivore 1 month ago. Got blood work done to check my levels. My cholesterol was 207. HDL 57 LDL 128. Just got my blood tested again today. Cholesterol 285. HDL 59. LDL 209.

Personally I think one of the tests must have been a goof because that’s a massive spike. But I’m no doc.

I workout regularly and didn’t have any slip ups with the diet. 

Overall I lost a decent amount of body fat which was the main goal. I had pretty stable energy throughout the day which was nice. And it was very easy to follow.

At the risk of my health I’ll be switching to paleo I think to try to keep the BF down and lower my cholesterol"

I am a bit paranoid about it. Please excuse my frequent posts/questions about it.

I know that diarrhea is quite common in the first few weeks, but I haven't heard anything about black diarrhea. I am a little bit concerned now and don't know if I should continue with this diet. Also, consulting my doctor wouldn't work, he already isn't in favor of me trying out the diet. Can't afford to go to a different one right now."

So far, to be getting my necessary calories in, I've been buying beef fat trimmings from my local butcher, melting them down in a big pot and then storing them in a mason jar in the fridge. Come dinner time, I'll fill a glass with the fat, microwave it, and then drink the glass of liquid fat along with my ground beef and eggs.

I definitely feel better the next day if I have plenty of fat, much less hunger, but it occurred to me the other day that this might not be healthy to do long-term, or that there might be better ways of achieving a caloric surplus within a small eating window.

carnivore,Few issues (an advice would be appreciated),"Hello

I seem to have problems with digestion and some physical/mental health issues. I was not satisfied with the treatments suggested by my psychiatrist and I'd like to try again to improve my health through diet and exercise on my own.

I tried this WoE two years ago for about 10 weeks and I had mixed results.

I had higher drive to exercise and I was less apathetic, my overall mood was probably a little better (but it's hard to tell, it was very stressful time for me overall). I didn't feel sluggish after eating and that alone was the biggest improvement for me.

It may not be related to carnivore diet, but one day I found out that my eyesight got better. For some strange reason, when I feel sick/depressed I could swear that my vision gets noticeably worse. I think I was also more resistant to cold, but I didn't really measure temperatures or tested that thoroughly.

I had few problems, though.

1. At the end I was defeated by sugar/carbohydrate cravings that never truly went away. I'm a sugar addict since childhood. I managed to get off opioids (needles), but I can't stop eating sugar. It's infuriating how much I'm craving this crap.
2. I had trouble eating enough (I lost some weight and I looked best in my entire life, but I was really hungry sometimes). For some reason I couldn't just force more meat down my throat. I tried drowning my food in lard, but it wasn't enough.
3. I've read that I should eat mostly beef. I love a good steak, but I hate the taste of ground beef. For some reason it's almost repulsive for me and on top of that it was causing terrible, long-lasting nausea. It didn't go away with time and I never solved this issue.

Any advice on how to approach it this time and avoid these issues will be appreciated.

Have a good day everyone."

carnivore,Are organs necessary?,"In terms of vitamins and minerals, do organs contain anything that I wouldn’t already be getting from just eating muscle/fat?

carnivore,"Lethargic, need help"," 

So  i am 19 years old male. Since childhood i was very anxious about  people, very shy person. As far as my memories go i had always low  energy, low motivation to go out to people, to spend time with them. As  the time went all those things only grew bigger in me. I am pretty sure i  have social phobia by now, but because of low energy i did not even  bother diagnosing it anywhere.

I  heard about carnivore diet year ago. I was on and off this diet since  then, mostly off. In december last year i ate half a duck and one steak  per day for one week and my life kinda changed. My personality became  more extroverted, i was more self confident, less caring about what  others think and my learning ability improved.

I  stopped feeling like that in the may this year and it never came back  to me. I suspect high sugar intake couple of days in a row did it to me.

In  hope of getting back this personality i was trying to go longer with  this diet since the longest streak i did this was 18 days. So about  month ago i gave it a best try i could and today is day 37 of the  carnivore diet. And for the whole 37 days i was ultra lethargic. i did  not have even close to pre diet energy levels once this whole time.  Other than that, my anxiety levels stayed the same or went up, my  deppresion was kinda better but still there whole time. The only good  thing was that my skin cleared up and my hair looks better.

My  diet was mostly ducks, because in my country there is no affordable  steakes to eat everyday and after ground beef i feel worse. I tried  adding fat by eating ducks with butter, no change at all. Thinking that i  still ate too less fat i ate bacon yestarday, still no change  whatsover. Eating fair amount of salt everyday. I also suplemented with  ALCAR in hope of faster fat adaptation but nothing helped.

Has anyone any suggestion to what should i do?"

carnivore,"Niacin IN MEAT helps prevent Covid, and tobacco addiction, in addition to all the other health benefits."," Found on another social media.  

This is another reason why people who eat Carnivore have had very little risk from Covid and other Flu-like diseases.   Carnivore eaters generally get several ""servings"" of meat per day.  

\------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Curious Case of Smokers Reduced Risk of COVID-19

In early 2020, data showed that there were a low number of daily smokers who went on to be symptomatic with COVID-19.25 This is curious, since COVID-19 begins primarily as a respiratory condition, and smoking is well-known for its harmful effects on the lungs.

However, if this is considered in light of niacin, an insufficiency of niacin may increase the risk of severe disease. Interestingly, nicotine and niacin are analogues — meaning they have similar means by which they work.26 In fact, successful nicotine addiction detoxification uses niacin to help replace nicotine in the body.27

This relationship may also help explain how teenagers become addicted so quickly to smoking. One researcher postulated that if a teen’s diet is insufficient in niacin, it would increase the body's craving for tobacco.28 According to the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements29 the recommended daily allowance for niacin is 16 mg for men and 14 mg for women who are not pregnant or lactating.

One serving of beef liver contains 14.9 mg, which meets a woman's requirement. Otherwise, to meet the daily requirement, a person would need to eat two servings of chicken, or two servings of salmon, or 3 servings of ground beef or 3 cups of brown rice. One medium potato contains just 2.3 mg, and one slice of whole wheat bread contains just 1.4 mg.30

These may be sufficient amounts to avoid pellagra, which is a severe niacin deficiency that can cause neurological symptoms and progress to paranoid and suicidal behaviors with auditory and visual hallucinations.31 Left untreated, pellagra can lead to death. However, it is easy to see how dietary intake may lead to chronic insufficiency.

According to Kats, the downstream effect of niacin is appropriate calcium signaling, which is responsible for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 from infecting a cell and for driving it out of an already infected cell.32 The process is regulated by nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), which is generated from NADP.33

Niacin is a precursor to NAD, which can be altered to NADP. So, without enough niacin, your body cannot make enough NAADP that affects calcium signaling and may therefore increase the risk of severe COVID-19."
carnivore,Thoughts on 25+ Eggs a day?,"Hey folks,

My Boy, 5 months Carnivore so far. Used to eat lots of meat based things but keeps cutting them down. Now just Steak Water and Eggs. Hes doing great. But he keeps upping his egg consumption. Im not concerned or anything as he is still getting 1-1 1/2LBS of steak a day but yesterday he put down 26 eggs. Basically he used to be eatting some ground hamburger, bacon, etc. That got cut into Eggs. Used to eat cheese which got cut down into steak and eggs.

Even as a near carnivore myself it just seems crazy. Hes active, fit, healthy has energy and no issues. But 30 something eggs a day?

Thoughts?"

carnivore,How do you make venison fat palatable?,"As a hunter, a large portion of my diet comes from deer meat I have harvested.  The protien in deer meat is very high quality, but pretty much every hunter I know cuts out and throws away all the fat. Many people don't realize that most deer do actually contain quite a bit of fat especially if they are healthy and well fed, but most people consider deer meat a lean meat because the fat is almost always trimmed off during butchering. As someone who eats a lot of fat I see this as a huge waste of potentially very good resource however there is good reason why most people don't eat the fat. This is because deer fat has a very high melting point and will quickly solidify on a steak that is cooking down. And when eating it, it will coat the inside of your mouth and have a strange ""mouthfeel"" that is unpleasant to most people. I've also discovered that deer fat goes rancid much quicker than fat from other animals because it has very high amounts of stearic acid and thus after the animal is down it is necessary to cut it off and preserve it right away or else it could develop a bad flavor. This is why I think most hunters cut it all off because they hang their deer for several days before butchering it to age the meat but this also makes the fat go bad. So my question is has anyone experimented with this fat and found a way to use it in a way that is palatable? I imagine if you can cut it off the carcass right away and render it into tallow and then freeze it than it should prevent any bad flavor and then all you have left is how to deal with the obnoxious mouth feel. I imagine out ancestors probably just ate it and maybe it's just an acquired taste. This is something I plan on experimenting with the next time I harvest a deer because I just hate to see something that could potentially be so valuable go to waste. Anyways was just wondering if anyone else had any experience eating deer fat or using deer tallow in a culinary endeavor. Thanks."
carnivore,Does carnivore help with hypertension?,"32 male and relatively fit. My BMI would have me at overweight however, I have a good amount of muscle on my frame so I dont believe that it has any bearing. I have been mostly carnivore for the past 10 months with a meat heavy diet but recently took a blood pressure reading which gave me 144/104 which is quite high and puts me at stage 2 hypertension. Doctors think I am crazy for not eating as much fruits and vegetables as they think I should and I am already relatively active. Is carnivore supposed to promote lowered blood pressure or has anyone had any luck lowering their blood pressure using the carnivore diet?"
carnivore,How was or is some of this stuff affecting you?,"
I've been eating carnivore for over a year and i've had a tightness around my chest all to the way down to my lower stomach. I removed cheddar cheese crisps (just found out all cheddar contains annatto which is plants) had to also eliminate bacon as it contains sugar people say it cooks off but seemed to be enough of a factor to disrupt this journey. I feel purer than ever all the horrible wet dreams have disappeared as well. Parm crisps has some nice original cheese crisps that taste even more amazing just cheese and salt so lovely. swiss cheese for my eggs mozarella for my burgers NO annato. How does some of this stuff affect you or was affecting you?

Side note: I just bought a pack of Perdue Harvestland Perfect Portions Free Range Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast which i ate and immediately felt my heart fluttering, no where on the package was the ingredients listed so I had to search it up on the site and it contained xanthan gum and modified food starch why do they insist in putting poison in our food? WHY CANT I JUST HAVE THE MEAT? lesson for next time i guess."
carnivore,"Been to 5 butchers in my area, none of them sell anything I need to stay healthy. Need advice.","None of them sell any kind of beef with the fat on or anything grass-fed. It's all lean, except for the crazy expensive choice cuts that I can't afford because, funnily enough, I can't drop $50 on a single steak every single day. The pork mince they have is full fat, which I've been eating for the past few days since starting this WOE (as well as free-range eggs which I can get easily so no problem there), but the pork's not pasture-raised and I'm starting to feel really unwell eating a kilo of it every day. None of the bones or organ meats they sell are grass-fed either.

What to do when no one in your area sells any real food on carnivore? Do I just have to settle for the crappy stuff and push through? Any and all advice would be appreciated."
carnivore,A week in into carnivore | bliss coming in waves,"I’m week into the carnivore diet my diet consist of ground beef / lamb, wild caught salmon, cod liver (1 can most days), beef liver (50g a day), and meat stock (drink one pound of cow bones worth a day).

I usually have around 2,000 calories a day this looks like 2 pounds of 80/20 beef (moderately salted) spread out and meat stock. I do cardio exercise and burn around 400 calories a day.

Overall I feel 10x better but I notice it comes in waves sometimes it’s like absolute bliss everything I’d imagine an anti-depressant to be then other times all I want to do is vegetate or general anxiety causes some heart palpitations.

My sleep is also very weird constant hyper vivid dreams I wake up quite a few times sometimes I’ll wake up feeling energized then I go back to bed and wake up slightly groggy.

Has anyone else experienced these waves in an adjustment period or do you feel my diet could be further optimized?"

I haven’t laughed much in a while.

carnivore,How I got off/cut down on milk.,"I’m not against milk but I was drinking way too much and I would easily guzzle more than a litre in just a few seconds and often more than 3 litres in a day. I weigh 75kg and as of next month I’ll have been carnivore for 3 years.

The short answer is powdered milk. Its basically dehydrated milk that you have to mix with water. It stops me from guzzling it as it doesn’t taste the best but when I really want some milk it will do and I have to make it in the frother and it can only make 100ml or so at a time so now I only have 100-300ml (sometimes none) per day which is 3-9 teaspoons of powder. 

Its really knocked my milk addiction on the head and recommend trying it if you are trying to cut down/out. 

One of the issues I’d have in the past was I felt I needed milk to seal off my hunger. The powdered milk does this but as I’ve vastly reduced the amount I’m having I feel I no longer need it to give me that satiety."
carnivore,When you reintroduce a food back into your diet - how long does it typically take to impact you negatively - if it does at all?,"Hi,

Been on the carnivore diet for about 4 weeks now.  I am trying this diet to help lower inflammation since I deal with a chronic pain issue.  Things were going good with that issues for a few weeks but I’ve recently had some flair ups.  Also I’ve recently reintroduced cheese into my diet and I’m wondering if that’s a potential culprit for flair ups.  I don’t feel the flair ups instantly after eating cheese - but for instance last night I was really hungry and ate a fair amount of aged cheddar cheese while I was waiting for my steak to cook.  I woke up this morning with a big flair up.  Is it common for intolerances from food to impact you hours later?

carnivore,Question about electrolytes,"Hi guys I started carnivore a little under a month ago.

I’ve noticed my heart rate has been slowly increasing over the past few weeks. After doing some research I realized that drinking alcohol needs to go. (duh) besides that, what else can I do to make sure I get enough electrolytes? I have pink salt that I put on every meal, magnesium glyc, and bone broth.

I noticed today laying in bed my heart was beating rather fast. I have bad anxiety but after reading about electrolytes I took a quarter tea spoon of pink salt, chugged some bone broth, and took an magnesium pill. This seemed to help a bit.

A website from google says
~5g sodium, ~3-4.8g potassium, 400mg magnesium 

Does this seem reasonable? I go to the gym 5 days a week. Should I just use the 3 items I listed above and take them when I start to get a headache/faster heartbeat or take a set amount each day?

Also, is there any supplementation that can be made for anxiety or is that something that goes away over time? My depression had gotten way better and my joints are happier than they’ve been in a while, but that damn anxiety just won’t go. Hoping over time it’ll get better and I’m sure being sober will help a ton. Not drinking a lot but enough to make a negative impact."

carnivore,Asking for a family member,"I’ve been on carnivore for a month. I’m finally starting to feel pretty great. I’m down almost 10lbs (and this is huge for me because I’ve been stuck at “the last few pounds” for a long time now on other diets). And since also quitting dairy in just the last week alone I’ve really noticed a lot of inflammation reduction. 

Anyhow, my mom is interested in starting carnivore but has concerns. She had a stent put in about a year or so ago because she had a 100% blockage in one artery. And now she has another artery with 70% blockage. She’s on cholesterol meds, blood pressure meds, is pre-diabetic, and is obese. She is 67. 

She’s not really educated on how all this works as far as “eating fat and cholesterol doesn’t make you fat or give you higher cholesterol” and so she’s concerned about the “what if’s” of going on this woe. 

I’m not really great at giving information about these things and while I’ve pointed her in the direction of a few carnivore books, I don’t know that she’ll get those types of questions answered. 

So I guess my question is have any of you had these same types of health problems and on medications before going carnivore and later saw improvements to your health? I don’t really know what to say to her and I don’t want to recommend she try it if there really are concerns.

TIA."
carnivore,Bought a whole sheep,"I've bought a whole sheep yesterday. Killed at noon, all parts went to freezer 10 hours later. Already ate barbecued loin and it tasted better than I thought. Skinning was done by me and my brother in law with the help of his father (a hunter and a butcher).

carnivore,Dog on carnivore diet diagnosed with chronic kidney disease—what to do?,"Hi everyone! I'm new here, so please bear with me. My 16-year-old dog, who has been eating carnivore (mostly beef and occasion organ meats) for the past 12 years, has just been diagnosed with early chronic kidney disease. He's been drinking a lot of water and urinating a lot as a result, but other than that he's alert, active, and eating well. His blood work and teeth had been perfect all these years. Then, all of a sudden, this.

The vet wants me to put him on Hill's Prescription Diet for dogs with kidney disease; it's supposed to be low in protein, sodium, and phosphorus, which they say are bad for him. But this food—all of these kidney support foods, really—are full of grains, corn, and soybean oil, and I just can't bring myself to give it to my dog who is not used to eating grains, starch, vegetable oil, or sugar. At the same time, I'm not sure what choice I have.

Any advice is much appreciated. Thank you!"

I got an Arctic King upright freezer, one of the smaller ones. The temperature dial is numbered 1-6, 1 being the warmest setting. Should I set it to the coldest? Or would #3 be cold enough?

I guess I should just plug it in and put a thermometer in it, huh?"
carnivore,Fastest way to cook lots of bacon at once?,"Bacon is about the only thing that appeals to me some days. It always takes so long to cook up a pound or two of bacon (when sharing with my family). 

Here’s what I’ve tried:
-Microwaving (but can’t get more than 5 slices in at once)
-Oven (can get more like 9-10 slices but takes much longer whether baking or broiling) and doesn’t always cook it evenly
-Pan frying (can’t get more than 4-5 slices in at a time)
-Air fryer (can’t get more than 3-4 slices at a time)

Any suggestions for easier/faster bacon cooking so it doesn’t take me an hour every time I make a pound or two of bacon?"

I also like to do it via arginine and whatever, but I think nitrates is a great secondary route. 

I know many plants have nitrates in them: beets, radishes, celery, etc but I'm not sure if animal products do as well?

It seems like they might: cows basically accumulate and concentrate the nutrients in grass, so maybe their blood or meat is rich in nitrates? 
I'm not sure, and I am struggling to find any information on it: cured meats with nitrates seem to be the only thing Google will bring up for me, not any info on the natural nitrates of animal products."

Compared to the Jurched soldiers, the Mongols were much healthier and stronger. The Mongols consumed a steady diet of meat, milk, yogurt, and other dairy products, and they fought men who lived on gruel made from various grains. The grain diet of the peasant warriors stunted their bones, rotted their teeth, and left them weak and prone to disease. In contrast, the poorest Mongol soldier ate mostly protein, thereby giving him strong teeth and bones.""

The problem: constipation, the poop is really big I have to push really hard which is painful. Afterwards, I spend on average 1.5 hours pushing out mucus, and even after spending so much time on it, I still feel really uncomfortable when I finally leave the toilet, as if the mucus was still there. 

Additional information: I usually eat ~ 250g of beef, 3-5eggs, ~100g of cheese, 100-150g of chicken and  butter. I use toilet to poop very rarely, usually once a week which I think is not normal, but taking into consideration it takes on average 2 hours, its a blessing.

Weight went from 298 to 254 (I am 6'4)

Blood pressure went from 138/83 to 114/72

Waist went from 42inches to 39

Dr Saladino also mentions that cooking bones during bone broth softens them to the point where you can eat them for calcium. However, I’ve read elsewhere that bones don’t become soft at all...

I was on a higher-protein SAD before this, so I understand I may still be getting fat-adapted but when (roughly) can I start expecting this muscle fatigue to turn around? I’m eager to get back to my workouts. And I hear my strength will be greater when I am adapted. 

Btw, I feel pretty good otherwise. I slimmed down about 5lbs (water weight I’m sure), also lost 1% body fat (had a scan done before and after starting), and while I’m still somewhat lethargic I do feel pretty good. And I’m supplementing with my electrolytes and drinking a ton of water."

Too much protein throws my blood sugars put of control. Too much fat and its bloat + diarrhea.

In any case, just listening to my body means I can have days where it's like a palm full of ground beef and one egg yolk for the whole day - including active work etc.

I don't want to force myself to eat because it's always a negative response.

carnivore,Experiencing Heavy Digestion With First Meal Of The Day,"Sup guys.

So I wake up at 6am each day and I typically don't eat till around noon. I'm not usually hungry until then and I have plenty of energy. Something that usually happens though, is that when I do have the first meal, an hour or two after I feel sluggish and tired. I can feel my blood going to my digestive system and I feel sleepy and weak. Then, after some time, it lifts. And any food I eat after that is totally fine. I have no heavy digestion for the rest of the day. Even if I pound steak and eggs until I can't anymore for dinner. It goes down like nothing. 

For the hour or two that I am experiencing the heavy digestion it really sucks. Today I'm going to try to eat a much lighter first meal to see if I can mitigate the effects I'm having. Also, I will say that when I drink liquids during that digestion period it makes things even worse. That being said, again, after that first meal and subsequent digestion period I can eat or drink whatever with no problems.

Wondering if anyone has any experience with this or insight into my situation. Thanks guys."

carnivore,Reason you became carnivore ?,"I am not carnivore myself, and I'm very curious about why people make this lifestyle. Of course meat taste good, but eating a lot of it do not forbid you to enjoy some vegetables and fruits on the side (they can even combine together greatly, like duck with oranges). For health I don't see either the point. You can get all your nutrients from meat, but it requieres to think much more about what part of the animal you eat along the week, and some time to spend a lot on some expensive parts you need. To me, it appears that it's much more easy to find the balance in your diet if you have two feet to dance on (meats and vegetables). I may be wrong but I'm curious, could you explain your choice ?"

Anyone else eating a similar product? While I feel it would be a really simple and a relatively cheap grass-fed beef product to eat every day, I'm concerned that I'll end up getting too much vitamin A from the liver over the long run. I'm not even sure at this point what vitamins are in kidney or heart that I should be careful to not overeat. 

Not sure on quantity yet, but I'm guessing if I ate mostly this mixture, I could eat at least a half-pound a day, maybe even a pound. This morning I had ¼ lbs with a 3 egg, heavy cream and cheese omelet, and I'm feeling really sated still an hour and a half later."

Am I doing something wrong? I’ve never in my life eaten that much salt on a daily basis (and 6g is the lower end of the recommendation!).

It’s worth mentioning too, that I understand this is in conjunction with magnesium and potassium for proper electrolyte balance, so I am taking those too and have been for years, so there’s nothing new there, just the salt supplementation is new to me."

It did *not*, in fact, make any difference whatsoever. I don't feel any better in any way and my slight excess mucus production issue (which inexplicably often gets blamed on dairy) was not mitigated in the slightest.

My opinion on dairy remains the same as it's always been. There are plenty of people who react badly to the lactose or to the milk solids, so it's important to make sure it doesn't affect you negatively. But if you have the biology for it, it's amazing.

And *delicious*. You don't realize how good dairy tastes until you stop eating it for a while and then come back to it. I just cooked some jambon au gratin in my air fryer and it was shockingly good."

Vs the second ribeye steak, per 100g, from a different shop: Protein 18.8g Fat 19.8g

As you can see, this is a wildly different ratio. The steaks visually look very similiar, with a very similiar amount of fat.

Why is this? I understand that they will use averages as each piece varies slightly but what could account for such a huge discrepancy? Is there just a standard nutrient count I should use for each cut and ignore what's on the pack?

We chatted for a bit and he mentioned they currently have a spice free no salt version but hinted at a sea salt version in the future. I think this product is gonna be big. Who doesn’t love crunchy pork rinds? We all love the texture, now just imagine that crispy crunch without the PUFA content. I’ll leave a link below 👇 feel free to reach out to the founders and ask any questions you have, I was surprised to find out that Javon himself had been strict carnivore at some point. I let him know I’m super excited about his product. Carnivore convenience is bliss.

carnivore,anyone try organs only? or even organs everyday?,"I’ve been noticing beef heart treats me well , wanted to know peoples experience with other organs"
carnivore,How do I convince my mom to at least try carnivore?,"My mom is 67. She’s overweight with IBS. She really needs to lose weight and would also like to solve the IBS issue. She refuses to even consider trying the carnivore diet - even though it would likely greatly improve her health. I just want to help her and see her live a long and healthy life. There doesn’t seem to be much that comes from me that would convince her though. So I was hoping I could get another perspective on how to get her to just try the diet for a short time. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on what to show her or say to her to get her to just try it for a couple weeks? Preferably a month. 

Thanks!"
carnivore,Does anyone use a meat grinder?,"Curious if anyone grinds their own meat and if so, what are the best/cheapest cuts to purchase for this purpose?"
carnivore,Track Calories or Just Eat?,"Hi All,

I'm in no way new to carnivore or meat at all, I'm somewhat of a meat fiend. I'm interested to see how many of you track calories on a daily basis and how many just eat as required throughout the day. I'm in my late 20's and walk around about 180lbs at 5'11, well trained and very active. I've always tracked calories as part of the lifestyle I have, hitting anywhere between 2700-3000 a day. From just eating meat alone I think I'd struggle to attain those numbers, I know organ meat and fattier cuts would help but I'm not sure to what degree. Happy to hear your tips for those of you consuming a fairly large amount of calories day to day."
carnivore,Multiple Bowl Movements,"It always takes me more than one sitting to fully evacuate my bowls. These sittings are always within an hour or two of each other, often even within a half an hour. This happens every time I go, regardless of whether or not my stool is hard or loose. Any help is really appreciated."
carnivore,Post Surgery Poops &amp; Carnivore?,"had open surgery Monday For a hernia that turned into multiple hernia repair.  operation took longer than expected.  ended up in hospital 3 days.  on opiate pain meds &amp; muscle relaxers.  hospital food was very limited so, I ended up eating much less than ideal in an effort to adhere to the diet and haven't had a BM since this weekend.  of course bms are monitored And they want to know when I do go.

Anyone have experience or information on being carnivore through and after surgery?  how to get the bowels to verify they're still working?"
carnivore,How many grams of fat is ok per day?,"Does anyone have a target amount of grams of fat they consume in a day, I know eat till your full but it’s easy to consume too many calories sometimes with that mentality."
carnivore,Did anyone have chronic fatigue that went away?,"Mine started 7 years ago and has progressively gotten worse.  I also developed around the same time heavy tired eyes like where your sinuses are.  I think my voice has changed too.  I've been tested for everything.  Only things to come back abnormal are upper endoscopy and sinuses.  I was diagnosed with GERD in 2007.  This year the imaging shows I have Barret's esophagus, small hiatal hernia, gastritis, etc.  Had nasal surgery last year due to chronic sinusitis.  Fatigue never improved but I feel the sinus pressure coming back."
carnivore,I no longer feel cold anymore?,"So I’m a pretty skinny guy and I always assumed that being this skinny meant that I was always going to be colder than those who weighed more than me which was actually true by a large amount. I used to feel the cold A LOT until just recently I started noticing myself not needing to turn on the heater during the winter and not feeling as cold anymore. My boyfriend who weighs more than me and is borderline overweight, not on carnivore, never really complained about it being cold except for me. But now it feels like the complete opposite and I’m confused since he didn’t lose any weight but now he’s the one who is complaining? I haven’t even gained much weight either since I’m always at around 66kg. 

It’s really weird because I’ll be in the lounge room and it will be 14 degrees Celsius and I basically don’t even put on a jacket. He starts turning on the heater and starts wearing a warmer jacket. Or when we go to bed he will complain of it being too cold when I open the window to let in more cold air.  We had some friends come up from Melbourne and I’ve basically seen them freeze during a winter breeze with a jacket on and I’m wearing less clothes than them and not feeling it at all!

I am starting to believe now that there is more to warmth than weight and I started getting into learning about brown adipose tissue which I seem to be making more of since insulin isn’t very present as much now, at least more of the beige kind if I’m right. This way of eating has definitely made this impact on my temperature.  

Has anyone else ever went from feeling cold to feeling warm? Summer is coming up and I also want to know though how you feel during the summer if you feel more hot or anything?"
carnivore,Musclemeat only diet and folate l,"I had to quit strict carnivore because I was feeling bad from deficiencies. Time to go round 2 and want to make sure I get no issues this time. Want to know if anyone can help me check which direction to go in.

So I developed severe folate deficiency after 3 months on carnivore and borderline iron deficient with normal ferritin and other iron related tests. The iron deficiency on this diet makes no sense.

I cannot source liver in my country. And guessing the folate deficiency may be due to the MTHFR nonsense, so does anybody think it's an issue taking a methylfolate supplement on a strict carnivore diet?

I eat only high fat ground beef when I'm strict carnivore."
carnivore,Where to begin?,"How did you start this way of eating?  Did you ease in, or was it more of an ""off the high board &amp; into the deep end"" approach?  I'm trying to figure out how to start this WOE, I guess I just need to see how others got into it."

carnivore,Troubleshooting some issues,"I’m wondering if I have some sort of histamine intolerance. I’ve been dealing with a runny nose after eating, and it’s badly stuffed when sleeping. I wake up every few hours during the night. Lately I’ve been getting intense brain fog and low energy starting around 4:00pm daily, despite staying on top of electrolytes. 

I eat whole sticks of grass fed butter, ground beef, canned fish, ground turkey, calf liver, chicken breast, and very occasionally mozerella or Greek yogurt. I supplement with fish oil, 8,000iu of vitamin D, zinc, boron, magnesium glycinate at night, and usually have salt/potassium during the day."
carnivore,What knife do I need for beef tongue?,"Right now I'm using a small fruit knife from the dollar store. I have no idea whether I'm supposed to cut the meat before or after cooking. I'm fine with anything, as long as it cuts the meat into small pieces."

carnivore,Cooked meat is more digestible?,"I heard that humans evolved because cooking meat made it more digestible, but I find that medium rare works best for me, because meat that's fully cooked seems to feel heavier in my digestive system. Does anyone else experience this?"

did I do wrong?"
carnivore,Game Meat and Carnivore,"Hello all!

I have seen a few posts and replies to posts lately about game meat and carnivore and wanted to start a conversation around this topic. Most of the comments were around game meat not being fatty enough for long term carnivore diet use in large quantities. 

What are your thoughts on using game meat and our ancestors using game meat for most of their diet? How did they do it? Do you think it was because there was a larger amount of game animals available and they were more picky about what they consumed? 

I’m curious if anyone has a theory on this, I am trying to do research on it now myself. Has anyone put serious thought into this?"
carnivore,Exercise and histamine,"I've recently started eating alot more and feleing good for it. I've been eating around a kilo of 20% fat lamb mince every day alongside around 100g of Liver. With the extra fuel I decided that I would run every day (Around 5k). 

But I believe the every-day running released histamine as my sleep suffered greatly (Felt like I never really got restful sleep), sinuses were really clogged up and also I started to feel really lethargic after aorund 1-2 hours after eating. 

My question is if running is ultimatly good for histamine intolerance and I'm emptying the bucket? 

Running everyday (Other than the symptoms) felf great and mentally I felt really clean. I know that exercise is great for ADD which is why I do it mainly. 

I want to run everyday but is it is just off the cards for me due to histamine?"

carnivore,Trouble with veggie re introduction,"Hey everyone I've been using carnivore as an elimination base, eating 2 mad - first meal 3 eggs 30g suet and second meal usually 454g beef and 100g suet. Last night I decided to add 100g of boiled soft carrots to my second meal. However, this morning I noticed I had a unusually quick bowel  transit time with visible bits of carrot. My question is, would this indicate a potential intolerance to carrots? Maybe my microbiome hasn't adjusted yet? Or is there too much going on in my digestion with the high fat high protein intake to incorporate a veggie in the mix?"

carnivore,Salt and pepper,Just looking for recommendations on a salt and pepper grinder set and what you use with them. I typically use medium Himalayan salt or Redmond brand and Tellicherry peppercorns. Just looking to see what others use for salt/pepper and the best grinder for these as well!  I go through a lot!  Thanks!
carnivore,Anybody hunt for the majority of their food?,"Just curious. It’s something I’ve been interested in lately as I’ve been learning more and more about the dangers of plastics. The thought of truly getting the majority (or even 100%) of my food from hunting animals like deer, elk, moose, hog, and bear (and maybe fishing) appeals to me.

I know it would be a challenge, but if anyone does it, care to share your experience? 

Fat intake is important and I’m also wondering how to get enough, since game meat is so lean."
carnivore,Is beef tallow supposed to be soft &amp; scoopable?,"Hi, everyone.

So normally I make my own beef tallow from suet and other trimmings of the beef that I cut off. The resulting rendered tallow is always hard, especially when placed in the fridge and cooled. I have gotten a little lazy lately and opted to buy tallow online instead of making my own since it can be a long and tedious process. I purchased the [South Chicago Packing Wagyu Beef Tallow](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0881XTCR3?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details) and was surprised that even after it stayed in the fridge overnight, it was soft &amp; scoopable which makes me question the quality of it. Any thoughts?"
carnivore,The carnivore voice,Why do people like Shawn Baker and Jordan Peterson have these gurgly voices? Even the man himself Paul Saladino has the gurgle in his latest video. What gives? I'd like to give carnivore a try some day but this puts me of a little
carnivore,Why am I so hot? Is this permanent?,"Hi, I'm brand new to carnivore. I started three days ago, and I'm easing into it a little bit. I have a few chronic health conditions that I won't bore everyone with, but I noticed that I get an increase in symptoms every time I eat, unless my meal is only meat. I know it's best to ease into it, but I'm just so tired of feeling like shit that I don't even want to eat anything but meat. So basically I've been eating grass-fed ground beef, beef liver, butter, salmon, dark meat chicken, land a little bit of sweet potato at the end of the day. 

Anyway, I've noticed that I'm SO HOT ALL THE TIME. I live in a hot climate, but I've never been \*this\* uncomfortably hot. I usually keep the thermostat at 78°F , and even then I have to turn it off sometimes because I would get too cold. But since I started carnivore, I have to keep it at 68 at night and I have it at 74 right now but I would rather have it at 70.   


Is this normal? Is it just meat sweats? Is this how men feel all the time?!?! (not gonna lie, it's making me feel less feminine and it's bumming me out a bit lol) I have been intermittent fasting too, and I'm still hot during the fasting part. Maybe I'm just finally getting enough iron? I used to take iron supplements and my iron levels were always on the low side of normal. It's not the worst thing in the world, I'm just really curious why this is happening and if it is a bad thing."

carnivore,Hives on Carnivore,"Just looking for some suggestions as to what people think about my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I am eating ground beef, eggs, liver, and some bacon.

&amp;#x200B;

And have developed some hives, mostly on my arms. Luckily you can't really see them, but they itch like a bastard.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize that it could be any or all of the things I'm eating. 

For the more experienced Carnivores out there, what are your recommendations? Just go with ground beef and see what happens??

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks"
carnivore,Opinions about drinking water during/right after meals,I have heard many things about this...I always thought I had to wait at least an hour after eating meat to drink some water (and been following that rule for the past 5 years or so). Recently I've read about 15 minutes but also saw people saying it does not matter at all... Does anyone have any good articles or knowledge about that topic in general?
carnivore,Needing help with stew meat and tallow!,"After reading a few posts, I'd like to try cooking stew meat in the crockpot. Low and slow. I read to add tallow and perhaps butter, but have no idea of the amounts of each to add and what else (if any) goes into the crockpot. Can anyone help me out with instructions?"
carnivore,Quality of meat..,"So I’ve been buying my meat from a Store called lion market, they sell ground beef for $1.65lb and ribeye or they call it ribeye for $4.99-6.99lb, it looks like ribeye too me but then again could be a different cut..I normally just buy like 8lbs of ground beef and eat that throughout the week. 

I have a buddy at work that’s always giving me a hard time for it saying that meat quality must be garbage because it’s so cheap and that doing carnivore I need to be eating grass fed/finished meats, also my omega 3-6 is way off.. 

Now I do eat organic eggs and buy good butter too cook my food with,and I heard that’s how bump your 3’s up.. does buying meat that cheap sound weird to anyone, should I spend more on my meat?"

carnivore,Mental clarity but fatigued,"I did a week of carnivore and I’m never been more mentally healthy in my life, but I was so tired and dizzy the entire time I’ve worked in potatoes, rice, spinach, and fruits into my diet and now I’m just a little less tired but all of the anxiety came back.

carnivore,Where are people getting fatty steaks in the UK for a good price?,"Been looking for fatty steaks (Ribeye seems to be the most expensive), where are you guys normally getting your steaks from? Tesco seems to have a good clubcard deal of 2 ribeyes (227g) for £7 but that's ending soon. 

Usually go to Morrisons for 20% mince as well, so finding mince isn't an issue."

carnivore,No longer burning in the sun,"For most of my life I was unable to go outside without a shirt on in fear of my skin getting burnt. Every vacation was a searing pain at the end and lake days were short lived. The burns were so bad I couldn’t sleep well for days afterward. All this burning didn’t mean a nice tan either, I’d just peel to a new white layer. But this past year I started eating people food and like pure magic my skin no longer burns. I was outside for 3 days in a row during the recent PNW heatwave and I got a little red on my shoulders with zero pain. Meanwhile all the people lathering in sunscreen got scorched anyway."
carnivore,Just starting but have alpha-gal allergy,"Like the title says, I have alpha-gal allergy, so pretty much stuck with poultry and Sea food.  additionally struggling with multiple IBD.  additionally I'm missing a gall bladder.  I've gotten the IBD relatively under control with bone broth and physican regulated abstinence from foods (don't know if the fa****g word is allowed in this sub).  but I'm trying to transition into other efforts while maintaining health looking for advice. also I'm a type that can easily consume 2900 carnivore Calories in less than an hour before I feel comfortably full.

I have epi-pens, and allergy pills and I haven't been re-tested since before the lockdowns.  It's possible for alpha-gal to abate but without testing or experimenting i can't say if I'm that Lucky.  so I'm thinking about taking the risk and jumping in.

i tried figuring out a pescatarian version but there's not much varieties for fats in this area.  and i ended up falling back on ""healthy"" plant foods.

I'm hoping to complete a 90 day challenge to see if it makes a difference in some of my health Issues.  

Is it hopeless for me?  Anyone ever been in the same boat or similar?"
carnivore,Not a lot of energy,I started off the first week eating around a pound of meat each day along with other things paired such as eggs and bacon and felt really good. Currently on OMAD and I guess naturally I’ve gotten less hungry by the second week so I’m down to about a half pound of ground beef a day with occasional eggs and bacon. My energy levels are super low and I’m pretty sure it has to do with me not eating enough but I don’t wanna overeat and ruin my weight loss. Any tips?
carnivore,Do we have to cook the meat and bone marrow before using it to make broth?,"Sorry if it sound like a dumb question lol. I'm pretty new to making bone broth. I used to buy it instead of making it. But, now I've decided to make it on my own.

I heard that its best to cook the meat and bone marrow before using them to make broth because it makes the broth taste better but honestly it's too much work. It's much easier if I could put everything in a pot and let it cook. Can I do that?"
carnivore,Oxalate dumping...,"So I've been 80-90% carnivore for about 2 months, and I'm pretty sure I'm getting oxalate dumping symptoms. I currently have a stye in my eye which has some hard grainlike particle sticking out halfway, unlike all the ofber styes I've gotten in the past that were tender and inflamed. Both my wrist joints are randomly hurting (3/10 pain) out of nowhere, and I got a random, first ever patch of eczema on my hand that just finished healing. Is there anything I can supplement or do to alleviate some of these symptoms? Or should I just weather through it?"
carnivore,Liver in college,I want a way to be able to consume liver in college but I will not have a fridge or any type of kitchen.

This is my second attempt at starting carnivore. I am doing carnivore because of bloating but mostly because of severe reactions to all plant foods which cause horrible upper right quadrant pain around my liver, and severe fatigue. (Functional medicine doc suspects this is related to effects of untreated lyme disease from years ago).

I am eating all types of meat, bacon, egg yolks and grass fed butter.   


I have been consistently eating these foods for three weeks now, but am now experiencing bloating and fatigue. This happened after my first attempt months ago and the bloating never went away.

I’m getting really frustrated and don’t know if it is die off or something else, but I’m just getting really frustrated. Any suggestions?"
carnivore,Calories,I started carnivore today and was shocked when I learned there were 1700 calories in the steak I ate. I ate about 2290 calories today. However I thought I had only eaten about 1200 calories.  Does anyone have advice on how to keep calories lower ? I might have to avoid steak.
carnivore,Calf Liver healthier than a Liver from an older animal ?,"I’m not sure what ages these calves live to which is why I ask.

I get mine from Whole Foods if anyone knows the brand, believe it’s the only one sold there

carnivore,What is the best strength for chicken bone broth?,"I put the bones of about 5 chickens in the Instant Pot.  That makes it near to the maximum line.  After wards when removing the bones there's somewhere between 3.5-4 liters of bone broth.  

It turns out great.  Is there a better ratio?  Also can it be bad for you if the bone broth is strong like this  and can you have too much in terms of calcium content or something else?"
carnivore,Would it be safe to drink bone broth straight from the fridge?,I made lots of bone broth last night and kept it all in the fridge. Would it be safe to drink it straight out of the fridge rather than heating it up?  Although I know it can be done in a few minutes lol sometimes I dont have time to heat it up.
carnivore,Free-range beef or lamb in the Netherlands,"I'd like to go live in Amsterdam but I have a friend that says the meat is more expensive there. Does anyone have any sources for getting decent meat are good prices?

I would need to buy a deep freezer there too, so my second question is how much space do I need to have in order to store around half a cow? I imagine that buying that much would definitely cut down on costs.

Thank you for helping me research this topic!"
carnivore,Stainless steel air fryer?,"What‘s the best air fryer with basket and drip pan made from stainless steel?

I am not too fond of the Teflon stuff and in cheap models this even tends to crumble away with daily use. Also you can‘t scrub it hard. Stainless steel should be more durable and even though it will stick more, it can be scrubbed."
carnivore,Which beef fat is the least toxic ?," 

I am on the path to understand more about histamine and fat toxicity.  
Evolutively, it seem that we stored the toxins around the belly, since the next time we had nothing to eat (regularly) it would be there waiting to get off us. I am speaking thousands of years of evolution, not just recently. Most mammals seem to have this protection.

Now I was told suet is the best, which is the fat around the kidneys but some just get any fat and don't bother.  
If I am correct, not only we should aim at the least toxic part (I still don't know the answer, I need your guys here please) but rendering at low heat without any meat or organs to help minimize creating histamine ?  
Does this make any sense and which part should be the least toxic please."
carnivore,Simple Explanation of Carnivore,"I am not a succinct individual when speaking lol. When I get asked about the carnivore diet, I end up rambling. How would you guys give a simple short explanation of 1) what the diet is, 2) why it works, and 3) how it helped you? I end up rambling on #2.

I'm a  holistic nutritionist who specializes in PCOS and also have it myself.  I became curious about this as a lifestyle intervention for pcos but there isn't much research available on this topic.  I recently started exploring carnivore for myself but I really want to know how it has worked for others.  Any input is appreciated. 

Thanks!"
carnivore,Alkaline water,"I just noticed for the first time alkaline water in the grocery store today. Does this have any benefit or relation to carnivore diets?

carnivore,Meditation on carnivore?,"I'm trying to break out of another binge eating cycle and want to go back to carnivore for various reasons, including weight loss, energy, and mental health/clarity. I've also tried getting into meditation many many times for mental health reasons but can never seem to stick with it. Considering the overwhelming positive effects from eating carnivore, I figured it might have an effect on meditation and I was wondering about other people's experiences with it. Does carnivore have a positive effect on your meditation practice, make it easier to start and/or stick with it, etc?"
carnivore,Salt... Again...,"Please help!! I really don't want to leave carnivore... I've seen so many great results/benefits since starting. But this summer I'm seriously struggling. I'm drink large bottles of salt water throughout the day. I'm strongly salting my food. But I'm having tremors and it's only getting worse and worse. I'm also unable to hold on to other water soluble things. Even though I'm drinking water, my urine is always really yellow... Drinking regular water is doesn't offer any help... I really don't know what to do... The tremors are reply bad some days....

I know that most of you don't need much salt... But.. Is there someone who does? I honestly can't figure out what to do. Especially because it is easy for me to go from having not enough salt to having too much salt. I can't figure out the balance. Like... Should I just accept that I'm simply not compatible with carnivore? This has been frustrating me to no end... And it's quite scary. But I do actually really enjoy eating this way. For the first time in three-four years, my body is finally doing what I want it to... But now I'm have this problem that feels hard to get past."

carnivore,Meat soup,"Wanted to put this in r/carnivorerecipes, but it said they only take posts from 'trusted posters'... so you guys get this!

Beef stew meat
Milk, 1/2 inch or so in the bottom of the slow cooker
A few tablespoons to 1/2 cup of broth
Seasoning of choice, I used Real Salt Purely Cajun seasoning

Cook in slow cooker until meat is tender.

No pictures because it looks awful, but it tastes a lot like beef stroganoff."

I hear a lot of people saying a 1:1 ratio in grams is good, but there’s a lot more red than white on a ribeye.

carnivore,"Momentary lapse, time to get back on the horse...and eat it","No, I’m not gonna eat a horse.   

Well, if the opportunity arose, I’d try it.   

I was a happy little carnivore for a few months, then went on holiday with the family for two weeks, and made one critical mistake: I didn’t take my air fryer with me. My air fryer had been a godsend for this WOE, so quick/easy/perfect for cooking meat and anything squeezed from meat. Two weeks of eating the old-fashioned way got me back into the habit of eating whatever I felt like, and in the following two months I destroyed all the benefits I had gained from months of reasonably strict carnivore.   

My knees ache, I’ve got a bit of pudge around the middle, energy depleted, and mood soured.   

Cracked the sads yesterday, had a big downer moment. Hated it. Decided to make a change.   

Back on board this morning with a gigantic pile of bacon and about a thousand eggs (the ‘Ron Swanson’ breakfast), and will be enjoying a huge steak for lunch. Possibly a steak for dinner.   

Thrown a huge lamb leg in the oven today which once cooked I will cut up and meal prep for work for the next few days. Lamb lunch will be subsidised with approximately 293 hard-boiled eggs, and lots of water.   

Time to get back on the horse, and get back to feeling like a superhero rockstar!"

carnivore,Best option for daily cooking of meat?,"Have been carnivore for almost 2 full years now and so far have always cooked on my cast iron pan. This has worked out fine for me thus far but I think it’s time to find an alternative. My wife is tired of the constant grease mess all over the stove and oven and of the house smelling like meat and bacon all the time and honestly I think she’s right. I’m constantly cleaning up my grease mess off everything around the stove and when I walk into the house I can definitely smell the meat smell, I’ve had family members over that say the same thing. My question is how do you all cook your meat and what is the best option for those that cannot cook in the house? I have been looking into different grills and meat cookers like the beefer but I’m just not sure what route id like to take. I thought about biting the bullet and investing in a kamado grill for the versatility but I feel like cooking on that thing multiple times a day would be a pain. I’m sorry if this has been asked before but I wasn’t sure where else to turn."

If anyone here is in Athens, Greece, does anyone know where I can get beef fat  or beef tallow?"
carnivore,Carnivore or Keto blocks cancer -- study,"Medical study reports that Carnivore or Keto blocks cancer, perhaps better than ""chemotherapy.""  

Doctors have known for years that cancer cells ravenously eat sugar.  Doctors use the cancer's sugar (and carbohydrate = sugar) appetite to detect cancer growth and spread in human bodies.  A common method is to 1. stop patient from eating sugar for a few days to starve cancer cells. 2. Give the patient high sugar drink with marked (radioactive or something) sugars.  3. Use scanners to see where the sugar markers go in the body.  4. The sugar ends up in the cancers that are consuming more sugar than the rest of the body.  That way doctors can find out how cancer has grown, if cancer has spread, etc.  But they never tell the patient to just stop eating sugar and avoid all their expensive and destructive ""treatments.""   It has been estimated that about 1/2 of reported cancer deaths actually are people who died from the chemotherapy.  

Doctors won't tell you to stop eating carbohydrates and sugar to avoid cancer, or to block cancer growth.  Here is published medical study.

carnivore,Any tips for handling fat?,"Recently I wanted to experiment adjusting my fat/protein ratio with upping my fat intake so got myself some grass fed fatty beef and lamb trimmings. 

I want to increase my kcal intake so I'm aiming for 200g of fat a day but the problem is that it seems my gut cant handle all that fat; The following day I had yellow diarhea which was pretty unpleasant. It's the same reaction taht I would have to having too much rendered fat; I was hoping that taking my fat in the form of trimmings might stop this happening. I did note that the trimmings basically were liquid after cooking.

I prepered the trimmings by cooking them in the oven and was wondering if theres a better way of cooking them; perhaps one that would cause less oxidation? Boiling? Letting them cool after eating? 

How do you folks cook your trimmings and how much do you have at a time? I was cooking around 100g for one meal of fatty trimmings and another 100g I would have mixed into my usual lamb mince.

carnivore,When to introduce other foods?,"Hello, I'm on day 65 oh eating only beef, salt and water. I've had nothing else. I'm doing this to try to treat illnesses I've had for many years, likely several autoimmune illnesses. 

I've lost one belt size in these 2 months. My weight, although no scale doesn't seem to have changed, so I'm assuming I'm eating enough. I feel pretty decent. Although I noticed I feel discomfort when I go out walking, as if I've got some general anxiety that my body doesn't like me walking and wants me to sit down. I think it might be that my body isn't good now at holding into water even though I consume plenty salt. 

As for the autoimmune, the worst is the chronic fatigue. I still have it, although improved. I'm overall not sure how much it improved from before I started eating this way. People told me potentially the beef only diet can reverse this after a while.

I was thinking about adding egg yolks to my diet; tossing the whites. Maybe 4-10 egg yolks a day. I just want to know if someone here eating carnivore for autoimmune thinks it's a good or bad idea? I heard before that eggs might not be so good."
carnivore,Steak and eggs versus just steak,"What does everyone think about eating 2 ribeyes a day vs 1 ribeye and 8-12 eggs?

Both meal plans fit my goals and calorie needs, but I’m wondering if one is more nutritious than the other.

Steak and eggs is certainly more economical, but if 2 pounds of fatty beef outweighs one pound plus 8-12 eggs I’ll consider paying for that extra health value."
carnivore,Carnivore over a year -- headaches all of a sudden,"Hi, I've been strict carnivore for over a year now and all of a sudden the last 3 weeks I'm having daily headaches. I figured maybe it was because I had been slowly increasing my salt intake over the last couple months. So, I cut down on the salt (I mix 1 part REAL salt / 1 part NoSalt), but the headaches are still going strong. Nothing else in my routine has changed, so I'm stumped. Any ideas? I mean, I cut WAY down on the salt...actually really prefer the taste of meat with hardly any salt. Is it possible that my electrolytes are still rebalancing? I started reducing salt intake about 10 days ago. Any thoughts? Thanks."

Oh man what goodness! It’s everything I love in my meat-meaty, gelatinous and fatty! 5$/lb from my farm store, it’s cheaper than stew meat with way more fat!

carnivore,Finally got my tallow order in!,"After finally finding somewhere to get a source of fat for cheap, (aside from pestering the butchers to keep fat aside for me to take/purchase), it took about 3 weeks to receive it, because of a delivery issue.. but now I have it! 

$1.60 / lb.  
With shipping cost turned out to be $2.20/lb  
Butter in my area is about $7.50/lb.. so I'm getting quite the savings!

Came in a 20kg / 44 lb box.

Took about 45 minutes to separate it into 24, 32 oz containers.  
Having never touched or seen tallow before, I didn't think it'd be so solid at room temperature.. So there was quite a bit of air bubbles I couldn't get rid of.

For future me.. is there a better way to get it into containers..?

Anyway, very happy with the purchase. Will save me quite a bit of money overall.

The taste it more or less what I expected.  
It's basically a neutral taste with a touch of beef essence.

On the counter, it's pliable.. like butter that's been sitting on the counter from the fridge for 30 minutes.

In the fridge.. it's hard as a rock. lmao  
Unless you want to keep a hammer and chisel around to chip away at it, I highly recommend keeping it on your counter.

as I believe everyone should have the opportunity to read it and come to their own conclusions, instead a moderator chose to the remove the post. In no way did this breach any of the communities rules, so why remove the content? It's not like I'm on an anti meat crusade, quite the contrary,  everyone should have freedom to read and share information relevant to the community. 

To the overzealous mod, why the hate? It disgusts me that you can't have any sort of open forum discussion on the internet any longer - let alone in a community like this - without being effectively cancelled when you seemingly step on the toes of an individual. 

I've purchase meat from Bel Campo and it's seemingly been a superior to other meat in the market, but does that mean we should stick our fingers in our ears, bury our heads in the sand, when something like this arises?

I hadn't gone since a year and a half ago due to anxiety over the state of my teeth (counter intuitive I know). I was informed at this appointment that I would require extensive work on 14 of my teeth. 


Well I went back today and now only 5 of my teeth will need work done. It was the same doctor as well. He asked me what I'd been doing, as he hasn't seen teeth and gum recover so well with no dental treatment.  


I don't even follow carnivore strictly all the time, but it still has helped so much by just being meat based for the last year. Meat really heals, and I look forward to seeing what else it can do. 


Good luck everyone!"
carnivore,Do Food Intolerances Ever Go Away?,"I've been carnivore for about three years now, and while I'm happy with the diet, it would be nice to not be so paranoid about additives. I can't even drink tea or take ibuprofen without paying for it. It's like I'm more sensitive now. I've been dealing with autoimmune disorders and IBS most of my life, I'm pretty over it."
carnivore,Calcium concerns,"My mother has really gotten on my case about calcium (though oddly she took my switch to carnivore in stride). She was an athletes and has weak bones now so I guess that’s why she’s so concerned. She was also a nurse so is very much kind of old school in her stance on health and is just passive aggressive about things because “I was a nurse so I’m an authority.”

Any resources or stories I can point her to? Specifically looking for long-term carnivores and women re: their calcium experiences and bone density. 

Thanks!"
carnivore,"Can I get a ""busy person's 5 min all you need to know"" guide?","So I've officially started this meat-only thing. I'm around the 48 hour mark, and as I've been browsing I've seen some stuff that makes me nervous, but I'm not finding easy answers. In particular...

Am I getting enough salt as a carnivore?

Something about Nutrient deficiencies. Can I just get a quick list of things I should add?

I JUST learned about ""don't trust a fart"". Thank fucking god I didn't learn that the hard way.

Only drink when thirsty.  (and uh.. I'm kinda nervous to drink water now.) Is there something I can add to just.. not have to worry about this part? (like sea salt?)

I was also reading about someone who had heart palpitations or something and a bunch people spitballing different ideas.

Anyways. is there anything else I should know that I haven't even thought of to look up that everyone new to this should know?

I'm trying to research this and learn as I go, but I'm stupidly busy, and due to severe and unbearably itchy psoriasis, I don't want to wait till I get it all figured out to start.

Please advise!"
carnivore,"I think beef might be too high in histamine for me, food allergy issues","Preface: my food allergies mean I'm carnivore till I die. It's not a negotiation situation.

Now that pollen season is upon us, my histamine levels are creeping up. It seems my sinuses have chosen to swell up after eating beef that wasn't stored frozen.

Has anyone with severe allergies found a fix for this?"
carnivore,Two questions for a noobie...probably know the answer but checkin.,"So when you are ground beef only, do you drain the fat? And which percent is best or is it a preference thing?

Ok 4th question...im supposed to eat this completely unflavored correct?"
carnivore,Sometimes I wish meat came in pellets so you could just swallow a handful when needed,"I get tired of cooking and cleaning, and sometimes I am tired of the flavor of meat.  I just want to measure out a handful of meat pills and swallow them.  Just enough to not feel hungry.  I was even wondering if I could cut up some stew meat chunks into smaller pieces and just keep a container of easy-to-swallow bits in the fridge that I could just swallow without chewing.   People kibble."
carnivore,Huntington's Disease advice on carnivore?,"Does anyone have any experience with carnivore and Huntington's Disease? My friend's SO was diagnosed, and I'd like to gather any resources I can for them. Carnivore worked so well healing my own autoimmune health, I'm just hopeful it can do something similar for an autosomal disease. 

I'll check back here in about 9 hours, but for now I have to go to bed.

Thank you to anyone who can help."
