vegan,I hate humans and I want to be vegan," I really want to stop being complacent and ignoring the fact that I'm constantly going against what I think is right ( Ex. Eating tortured animals and their products, food that has been processed beyond recognition in pollutive factories and produce that has been shipped across the world and farmed essentially by slaves). I have no idea where to start and I'm super intimidated by the idea of really taking responsibility to do the right thing. I'm lazy and I know if I take on too much at once, I'll abandon ship and go back to trying not to think about the bad I'm doing. 

Any tips on how to get started and stay on track? I wish I could just photosynthesize."
vegan,Hypothyroidism and plant-based diet-your thoughts?,"Hypothyroidism and plant-based diet-your thoughts?  
 Does anyone suffer with Hypothyroidism? Do you feel your plant-based diet can help with this?  
I'd love to hear other people's thoughts because I recently got diagnosed!  I came across this video and wondering if there's a link

vegan,gardein Buffalo wings,"I bought myself some of the gardein Buffalo wings as a splurge. And holy moly these things are ridiculously spicy!!!! I can handle a lot of spice, I love spicy food and growing up my dad was way too generous with spicing food. but this has my tongue completely numb after just a few bites. They taste great but I'm practically about to be sick from how horribly spicy these are. Has anyone else tried these and thought the same?? Like I said I don't feel like I'm being weak here, these are just way too hot to eat."
vegan,The vegan movement as a problem,"As the largest community of vegans on the internet we need to make sure that we are advocating for veganism as affectively as possible, and I think discourse in this movement as a whole needs improvement.

I see many people in this sub are quite frustrated and angry at people who still eat meat and while these feelings are 100% valid it's important to remember that affective vegan advocacy comes from a place of empathy and understanding. We can't let these negative feelings transate into how we communicate this ideology to people. 

This disgust at how animals are treated on farms can make people feel judged or shamed for supporting it. As soon as people feel judged their defence mechanism will kick in and we will loose them.

We need to remember the perspective of someone who eats meat in order to successfully advocate for the vegan lifestyle. What we are advocating for is not just a dietary change but a complete change in how humans relate to other animals and nature on this planet. It cant be understated how much of a colossal change in perspective this is and it's unlikely anyone will go vegan from a single conversation.

Someone coming out of conversation thinking veganism is more reasonable than before is still a massive win for this movement! For many people their perspective on animals has never been challenged, what we should be aiming for is to plant the seed. The two most important tools at our disposal are the Socratic method (asking questions so they investigate their own perspective) and positive encouragement/reinforcement.

It's only a matter of time before animal agriculture as we know it is abolished and the better we get at advocating this change, the more animals will be spared!"
vegan,Making oat/rice milk at home doesn’t seem to work,"Hello everyone, recently I started to try making vegan milk at home, but the result is always not enjoyable in taste or either texture. It’s dense and lacks taste. What can I do? I used the methods of blending and filtering I found in YouTube videos. 
(I have accessibility to buy it in stores btw, I just enjoy cooking)"
vegan,Had to put an animal out of its misery and it’s really bothering me,"A few hours ago I heard screeching in my back yard only to step out and see my dog had mortally injured a rabbit. She wasn’t planning on killing it, she just kept picking it up and dropping it/ gently shaking it.

I called my dog inside and unfortunately the rabbit seemed to be paralyzed from the neck down. It was lying on its side breathing rapidly, writhing its head around, and its little eye looked terrified.

I contemplated what to do for a couple minutes hoping that it would pass on, but it seemed that the rabbit would slowly die in agony for at least a few hours. 

I decided I would have to put it out of its misery, so I grabbed a fluffy towel and placed it over the rabbit. I found a large rock and crushed it’s head. It died instantly and I dug a grave for it and placed some rocks over the grave so my dogs wouldn’t dig it up.

I feel like I did the right thing by ending its suffering, but it’s bothering me so much. I think the brutality of the situation is what’s upsetting me. If I could’ve just snapped my fingers and ended it’s suffering I don’t think I’d feel as awful. 

I’m not sure if this post is appropriate on the sub but I couldn’t think of anywhere else to put it. I’ve been considering veganism for a few months, this may be the deciding factor."
vegan,"How to dispute the claim of, ""oh I buy the good organic stuff, not from those horrible factory farms.""","I encounter a lot of people that think the meat/eggs/dairy that they buy is from some ethical magical farm that isn't so bad to the animals. They buy organic and cage-free and think that's enough and play dumb about what is actually happening to the animals they consume.

How do you dispute it? Is there a way to look up all the meat supplies for Kroger for example? Most non-vegans I know have no moral obligation to killing animals for food, but do not like them to suffer abuse while they're alive or during slaughter."
vegan,Need Advice,"Okay, so I feel stupid for posting this here...but oh well. I need advice on multiple issues. 

Two months ago my partner and I broke up, since then I can't fucking eat. Today I ate two packets of oatmeal and that's it. Before we split I cooked all the time. I loved looking up recipes and trying new meals that took me 1-2 hours to make, and they were always amazing. We went to the grocery store together and picked out stuff together and I would be 'head chef' most of the time and they would be my partner. Since we split I can't bring myself to cook anything. I even cried in the grocery store one time bc it was something we always did together. I have no appetite and don't even want to eat packaged vegan foods. Plus, packaged food is stupid expensive. What are some cheap, nutrient dense, and calorie dense vegan foods that I can sustain myself on?

Secondly, I don't feel like I will be able to date someone again with my moral views. My ex was my first love and we shared the same views. We both started dating as omnis but after a few months went vegetarian ---&gt; vegan together. I'm not trying to brag, but I am a pretty attractive guy that gets attention whenever I go out. However, I don't live in a place where there are that many other vegans and I definitely would not want to go on dates with an omni. I don't even really want to go on dates bc I still love my ex and don't really want to be with anyone else...but I guess going on a date would help me to move forward. I don't even know how to find any other vegans.

Third, I'm lonely in my vegan point of view. I don't know anyone else, besides me and my ex that is vegan, and that is very disheartening."
vegan,Vegan level unlocked: eat so much nooch your pee is neon yellow,"I sometimes noticed my pee was neon yellow. I thought for so long that it was because I just wasn't drinking enough water, but even with a gallon (4.5L for you people in civilized countries) a day minimum it was still happening.

Then I finally realized that it only happened on the days when I'm going to town on some nooch. Not the ""I'll sprinkle some on my salad"" days -- the ""I better bring this container with me to snack on while I watch this show"" days. A little internet searching and I see it's something about vitamins or whatever.

Anyway, I just wanted to *Bragg* (heh heh) about it."
vegan,Is it vegan to order vegan food from a restaurant that often messes up and serves animal products?,"How do you guys feel about ordering vegan food from a restaurant that tends to make mistakes and give non-vegan food (such as adding sour cream or cheese to food).

Would going to this place be vegan because you ordered vegan food, or would it be non-vegan because there's a decent chance they'll give you non-vegan food?

If they give you non-vegan food it makes sense to just eat it instead of waste it, right?"
vegan,Would you eat lab-grown meat/fish?,"I’m sorry if this is rude, but I’m honestly curious how vegans would feel about this? Science has come out in recent years with news of successfully growing meat in labs. Would you eat that, since no no animal was killed in the making? 

I’m becoming a vegan for health reasons primarily, so I probably wouldn’t eat it. I went vegan for a few months and my high cholesterol became normal, so I’m going vegan permanently because I don’t want to need a pill for that. I’m also going vegan for environmental and moral reasons, but the health benefits are the primary reason.

Again, sorry if this question is unwelcome here."
vegan,I'm just so angry,"So I'm 15 and have been vegan for about a year now and the rage I am experiencing on a daily basis is getting pretty ridiculous. I know the anger is justified but I really don't know how I can help to release just a bit of that rage. I'm not allowed to do any kind of activism other than try to politely tell my family that their attitudes towards non-human animals are wrong. It only makes me more furious that since I live in a very farming-heavy rural area of England, when I go to school I'm just sitting next to a load of animal abusing scumbags laughing about the death of the individuals they shot in the head last weekend. Is there anything I can do? Anything I have tried to do at home just ends up amounting to nothing whether it's talking to family or talking to people on the Internet who are just coming up with ideotic justifications for the shit they do every day."
vegan,Mom messed up her back this weekend so I got to make the whole family a vegan meal!,"They loved it! Rice and veggie curry with homemade samosa’s. 

I was so surprised everyone enjoyed it, I took a risk making Indian food (they’re pallets are very american pub and italian centric), but i thought it would be a good route since it doesn’t require a ton of substitutions and comes together very quickly. feeling good today, hopefully this leads to me being able to make more vegan dishes for our family in the future."
vegan,vegan meals that are high calorie and can be eaten fast,"I hate eating food in general.i consider it to be time consuming and unenjoyable past the first few bites. I would rather be doing something else. vegan meals are typically a lot higher in volume to eat and therefore more time. I want meals that can be eaten in less than 10 minutes and around 1000 calories. A good meal for me is peanut butter on whole wheat bread with applesauce, but I know that's lacking in vitamin c(etc).i also enjoy cashews and bananas together. It's a pretty quick meal, but I find most bananas to low quality to enjoy raw and cashews sometimes pricey.i like oats for a working out food but 2 cups of oats for enough calories plus liquid to inflate them is time consuming to eat. Any high calorie protien bars I can make homemade or something else?i heard hummus wraps were fast to eat.any ideas."
vegan,Cadets and Rations,"I’m an army cadet and I really want to have ration packs but I’ve been told they don’t do vegan options. Any idea where I can buy vegan ration packs or would you say since there’s not another option then I should have the vegetarian ones.

You can bring your own food but it’s incredibly hard to make your own ration packs with the right about of nutrients even without being vegan."
vegan,I am sad and beyond disgusted...,"TW: Mentions of animal abuse and curse words

Oh my goodness. I couldn't even finish the documentary, ""Dominion"" because of how brutal and horrific the animals are treated. I paused at the pig section and was just about in tears because of how miserable those mother pigs are and on top of that, have to watch as most of their babies die. Oh, and what about the runts or ""useless"" pigs? Yeah, farmers just whack them on the fucking ground to murder them! What in God's name possesses those people to obtain those jobs? I get not having a choice where you work, or if you're an immigrant coming to the US and are in need of a job, but why, WHY would you take that job of all the other jobs out there! Even if you feel like you don't have a choice, YOU DO! 

God, those poor animals. I don't think I will continue to watch the documentary because the 10 minutes I did watch were enough to convince me that I will never eat meat, dairy, etc.. again! Fuck the dairy farms, fuck the pig farms, and fuck every other farm or industry that inflicts this torture on innocent beings... Sorry for my language, I am just so sad and devastated. I knew it was bad, but I didn't know it was THAT MF bad! I wish that I could go in and grab every single one of those pigs and take them home so I can let them roam free, eat a proper diet, drink enough water, care for their young, and most importantly so that I can love them. I want those animals to know that they are loved and cared for. 

I don't know exactly what I was gonna do with this post, but I just needed to rant, and I needed to let other people who are wondering if they should go/stay vegan that they 110% SHOULD go vegan. If we keep supporting these industries, the abuse will never stop. From this moment forward, I will never eat, drink, or consume a single animal byproduct. 

If anyone has any tips or bits of information they want to add, please do so. That documentary traumatized me so much... all I can say is I am sorry. I am sorry to the animals/products I have previously consumed, I am sorry to this community, and I a sorry to myself. For not recognizing/doing something sooner. Thank you for letting me post and for reading through this."

Like I'm supposed to be impressed by that? ""Congratulations on being weak and fake?"" I have no clue what they hope my response will be to that.

 I'm the vegan MC, and I'm here to sa

I don't need their flesh or their blood on my pants

I'm getting all my nutrients from corns and from plants

I don't need it to survive, I have alot to eat

Eating animals is wrong, and it's time that we all see

vegan,Designer bags,"So I just got my first big girl job and I've always wanted to treat myself to a nice bag once I achieved this milestone. In my research in the resale market, I'm finding it so incredibly frustrating how many brands put unnecessary leather detailing on their canvas/nylon bags. There are so many nice non leather bags out there that literally have leather lining on the inside, it makes no sense and it's disgusting. I don't want to see animal skin on my bag, even if it's hidden. So many brands now have stopped using real fur and acknowledged its cruelty, but where's the outrage for the leather? It's complete virtue signaling and is incredibly frustrating"
vegan,I would like to expand my cultural appreciation through vegan food. Can anyone suggest food from regions that have lots of vegan cuisine?,"Hi. I have made it a point to switch over to a mostly vegetarian and vegan diet.  A couple different things have led me to this (animal rights concerns, unteaching myself things that my abusive family taught me, realizing that eating certain meats and animal products causes me gastrointestinal distress, seeing a mother fox get hit on the road and the reaction of her kit).  Anyway, I've been trying to eat meatless for about a month and dairy-free for about two weeks.

That said, I grew up in a very conservative southern home where my dad hunted, and my mother always had to cook meat with every meal.  All the foods we ate were very ""Traditional American"" (for lack of a better term).  This has made the switch sort of difficult because I'm having to relearn how to cook.

To make matters a bit more difficult I am extremely allergic to soy and I'm not a massive fan of meat substitutes.  I've found that, where I live, most vegan convenience foods have a good amount of soy in them.  Due to that I have been cooking everything from scratch.

So, I have been mostly eating bean and rice, stir fries (using Maggi's as a substitute), and Indian food.  I do enjoy proteins that are not reminiscent of meat.  I've made chickpea tofu and cooked with Pumfu a couple of times now as well.

I have noticed that I'm happiest when I prepare foods from cultures that don't eat as much meat instead of making carnist food vegan.  Specifically, I've been really enjoying Indian food.  It makes my home smell gorgeous.

I would like to explore more food from cultures that traditionally do not use as much meat or animal bi-products.  I feel that exposure to different cultures through food is helping me not only learn to cook differently but also to gain appreciation for cultures that would have been shunned by my conservative parents.

With all that in mind, I am searching for traditional dishes from other parts of the world to make in my home.  Can anyone help with ideas?

Thank you so much."
vegan,Do you think you could convince your 'old self' to go vegan?,"Back when I was a teen/younger adult, I was that edgy guy who didn't think about much.

Really wanted to be a ""traditional"" man, wanted to hunt, hated lefties with a passion. Yes, Ben Shapiro was my favourite. 
Then I met a woman, we worked together for a bit and started dating. She was vegan, I didn't mind but I knew I was never gonna be one. She was with me for 1.5 years before, with the help from her, I became vegan. She turned me into a better person. I could never date a non vegan now, I don't know how she did it, but she did. After a year of veganism, I still consider myself a hardcore vegan, would still never date a carnist or vegetarian. Veganism just seems so right and I don't see how past me could do such stupid shit. Anyways, rant and shower thoughts over.  Peace out my homies. 

P.S fuck Ben Shapiro"
vegan,Any tips on finding Vegan food on a roadtrip through Greece?,"Hey there!

In a few days I'll start my 2 week vacation in Greece with my (not vegan, but tolerant) friend. We'll be doing a road-trip light, moving between cities, staying in each place only one or a few days at most. In case it's relevant, we'll stick to the mainland, starting in the Peloponnese, then making our way north.

This'll be my first vacation since going Vegan, and my first time in Greece, so I'm a bit worried about finding food. Especially since we'll be moving around, so I can't just look for a Hotel that has Vegan Food.

Are there any people from Greece here who can tell me how common Vegan options are, and any tips about brands, or labels or stuff like that?And any general tips on finding Vegan food in foreign countries?

Any advice will be much appreciated!"
vegan,AITA for refusing to serve/deal with meat products,"I work at Starbuck’s because it’s the highest paying job I could find in my area at the moment as I work part time through college, and I got hired recently. It’s not the best place to work considering all of the animal products being sold, but my options are severely limited in the small town I live in so please be understanding. 

If I’m not the supervisor in charge and they try to put me on front and food, I decline because I refuse to touch/serve/overall deal with any meat products. There are much more undesirable tasks to do there and I always say I’d rather do those tasks, but they said they wanted to have a sit down discussion with me over this issue. 

Am I being dramatic?"
vegan,Health anxiety preventing me going vegan (advice please),"I'm hoping to get some advice here because it's clear that veganism is ethically superior on so many fronts and it's something I WANT to do but am afraid to.

I'm a hypochondriac/have health anxiety, and my main concerns are: nutrient deficiency (e.g. iron, B12, iodine) and loss of muscle mass due to insufficient and incomplete protein - this is partially a self-esteem thing as I'm worried about losing muscle mass and my appearance being affected.

Currently my diet consists of a lot less meat than it used to, whereas before I'd eat it almost every meal, now I'll go days without it

I've learnt to cook meals that subsitute meat and at this point I could easily cut it out and not miss the taste as there are delicious vegan meals (also I don't think missing the taste is a valid moral reason to continue to eat it).

Maybe I'm overthinking it - but can someone help with the current substitutes I make and tell me if they are nutritionally equivalent, and if not what to add:

- Spaghetti bolognese (lentils and mushrooms instead of beef)
- Chilli (red kidney beans, no beef).
- Curry (chickpeas instead of chicken)
- Rice (no meat, just mushroom, carrots, leeks, lentils)

This is my main meat-less cooking repitoire at the moment 

Other things I eat a lot of are: peanut butter on toast, all-bran, oats.  I do eat a fair amount of eggs and would find it hard to replace this as they are so good nutritionally (any advice on that?)
 
With these examples, are these adequate? 

From what I can tell, there are high protein vegan foods, BUT they are also high in carbs compared to meat? There is also the issue of iron. I know there are high iron plant-based foods, but it is non-heme iron.

I'm not hugely keen on the whole ""plant based"" meat replacement products that are factory produced so my preference would be to focus on making substitutes that are natural.

Any advice is appreciated, thanks"

vegan,"Wanting to become vegan... quick questions for pagans, genuinely curious!","At the risk of being completely downvoted, I will be completely honest... I am pagan, &amp; think I want to go vegan, but really struggle with the idea for few reasons. Here's a brain dump, any thoughts/feedback/your input/personal beliefs are greatly appreciated!

* I worship the Greek Gods primarily, and have heavily studied the Theoi &amp; Hellenism &amp; ancient cults etc., mostly Orphism. They were ""vegan"" in the sense that they didn't eat animals, but I did learn that they would have milk &amp; honey, maybe fish. Back then they treated animals far nicer than now though obviously, so what does this mean? Can morals change over time?
* Artemis is both the protectress of animals and huntress. She revered animals and took care of them, but also hunted them. It's an interesting balance, and I have a hard time thinking being vegan is the right choice, when Artemis would hunt animals somewhat. I asked her through divination if I should be vegan, she said it was about intent. I asked Athena &amp; Demeter, and they said yes, I should be vegan.
* The ancients would sacrifice animals to their Gods, and rarely eat meat, because it was so expensive. But when they did, usually it was because they had sacrificed the animal first. Wouldn't it be okay then to eat animals now, especially if we offered a small portion to the Gods? In no way am I saying torturing/sacrificing animals is okay... of course.

I have such a hard time with this, and am constantly thinking about it. I've seen Dominion and other documentaries, and think I should be vegan, and want to become vegan, but I just don't know if it's ""in line"" with my religious beliefs... any tips/thoughts?"

Now, about 18 months later I got them done again and I nearly fell off my chair when the doctor told me my iron levels were too high. I still take iron supplements so going to stop that now lol but was wondering if this had happened to anyone else?

vegan,Getting confused about B12 doses,"I have some 40 ug tablets, but I'm not sure if it's right.

I get so confused with all the conflicting information out there. I've read that daily you only need 1.5 ug/day of B12, but because of absorption rates, you should take a higher dose than that.

The vegan society says: *'Take one B12 supplement daily providing at least 10 micrograms OR take a weekly B12 supplement providing at least 2000 micrograms.'*

But then I saw on Healthline: *'Note that the percent of vitamin B12 your body can absorb from supplements is not very high — it’s estimated that your body only absorbs 10 mcg of a 500-mcg B12 supplement.'* So by this logic you absorb around 2% of a supplement, so if I took a 40 ug tablet I would only absorb 0.8 ug?

Plus I read a few journals which all recommended different amounts (50, 25, 14 and 4 μg/day)...

Just wondering what doses people take and if 40 ug/day is enough?"
vegan,"Non-vegan friends hit me with the ""no ethical consumption under capitalism"" line","Was with friends at a park and we fired up the grill. I brought out my Beyond burgers, didn't say a word.

They have a short convo about how animals die anyway so there's no point. And friend 1 says ""Yeah, there's no ethical consumption under capitalismm.""

I just ignored it and walked away. How do you guys deal with friends like this? It felt like a personal attack honestly. 

I've been vegan for nearly 8 years and they both know this."
vegan,thoughts on kangatarianism?,"I'd like to preface by saying this isn't a troll post or something to try bait you guys into getting mad.

Currently, I'm what you'd call a ""carnist"", however, the older I get, the more and more I begin to think about the ethics of all of this, and the needles slaughter of unfathomable numbers of animals just to put food on our plates. The more I read, the more I am starting to consider changing up my eating habits drastically.

I'm just wondering, what are your thoughts on kangatarianism? (Those who only eat kangaroo meat). ALL kangaroo meat comes from kangaroos that have been culled as a form of population control. With that in mind, surely it is considerably more ethical to eat as opposed to eating something purely killed for food? I'm not saying culling kangaroos for population control is ethical or the right thing to do.. but, the reality is, it happens regardless, and even if everyone stopped eating kangaroo meat entirely, it would still be happening regardless. 

My thoughts are, if they are sadly going to be killed as a form of population control, then what argument could be made about why their meat shouldn't be eaten? If their meat wasn't eating, they'd be getting killed in the same amount of numbers anyways. Surely with this in mind, eating their meat would at least mean that their deaths were used to feed people, rather than them being killed and then just discarded? Kangaroos also live their lives in natural environments eating how they should, in the wild.. rather than being cooped up in farms and bred for food. 

Proponents of kangatarianism argue that it's an ""ethical"" meat since they aren't being killed FOR their meat at all.

I'm just very curious to hear what vegans think about this.

For some more info, this is what I am referring to:

vegan,Snowflake Mountain (spoiler) -- Props to Devon (and the rest of the group),"Hey y'all (spoiler alert ahead),

I just caught Snowflake Mountain (episode 2) on Netflix.

Think what you will about the cast, but I have to say it was pretty nice to see Devon just full-on opt out of ""processing"" the deer because of veganism.  I also thought it was nice that the other members didn't judge her at all, while some even commended her for it.

Sure, it's all scripted being a reality show, but I just appreciated that there wasn't really any stigma about her being vegan, especially in a show where I'd expect it.

vegan,Copper toxicity,"Hi everyone. So unfortunately I have had been having problems with my copper iud being super painful, and I was reading around other stories and came across this website. It basically states that being on a vegan diet causes copper toxicity. This feels like absolute bullshit, and I was wondering if there were any vegans who could help tell me why. Of course I plan on staying vegan and this is a lifestyle choice, but it just seems wrong to say that eating meat is healthier. But this website just seems wrong.

vegan,Birthday Rant,"I just need to express this somewhere where people will get it and can commiserate with me.

So I've come into my BFs friend group and have struggled over the years to feel like I'm really a part of it and not tangentially there as ""the girlfriend"". I wound up deciding not to celebrate my birthday (something I've been wanting to do for years, and this friend group tends to go hard celebrating each other's birthdays) because I just had this feeling no one would show up or anything like that.

Well my BF decided to surprise me with a surprise birthday! And people actually showed up. The kicker was though he knew that I wanted it to be vegan food because I obviously don't want to celebrate my life by abusing and killing others or by being surrounded by so much cruelty. I get enough of that the other 364 days of the year. He let them know very clearly we would be providing all the food and that it would be vegan. You can guess where this is going.

We spent about $220 on food and, without saying a word to us, they all showed up with 2 large meat and cheese pizzas, fried chicken, chicken rolls, cheesy chips, and a 20 pack of frozen beef burgers and cheese. They touched nothing we provided.

Honestly, it really fucking hurt. We had a vegan cake which got comments like ""maybe veganism isn't so disgusting if that's what the cake tastes like"". They loved it which was good, but it just highlights how they've never eaten any of this stuff, assumed the worst to excuse never touching it, knew we were buying food for about 20 people, and brought their own food without saying a word to either of us so we could either save our money or ask them to give this one single meal for not eating meat.

This was last night but I'm still so angry. I love my BF to pieces for doing this for me, but yeah. I think I'm over birthday parties. People are assholes and maybe these people aren't really the people I need to be spending time trying to befriend. I have a couple friends who are both vegan and deeply kind or at the very least omni but respectful. I'll just focus on them and the (omni) roommates who are at least respectful (I actually cook for them a lot, and they're fine with plant based food).

Thanks for listening to my rant. I know I'm far from the only one who has dealt with stuff like this, so what's your birthday stories?"

vegan,Can you guys help me out with some cheap easy fast soy-free vegan blogs/recipes/resources?,"I had an incident recently that has made me rethink how I live and eat.  So, for the past two weeks or so I have been adhering to a plant-based diet. I have a severe soy allergy, so I have been avoiding it as well.  Regardless, I was doing well (and feeling better than ever) until today.

Today, I was stressed and need to make some food quickly, so I threw together some sandwiches with meat on them.  Now, I am experiencing severe pain in my digestive tract.  Looking back, I think I always had pain after eating some meats.  As I frequently had abdominal pain which was brushed off as ""lady stuff"".

What I'm slowly getting at is that I think I need to break the habit of quick meat-based meals both for moral and health reasons.  

I am hoping that some people around here might be kind enough as to point me to some soy-free recipe resources that are fast, easy, and preferably fairly cheap.  Our household only has two members so it would be great if the recipes didn't have tons of ingredients (we don't seem to be able to finish everything).

Thanks so much.  Sorry if this is poorly written.  I really am in very severe pain."
vegan,Do you avoid artificial dyes?,"So I know most dyes are “plant based” but I can’t find a better community to discuss this, just need likeminded individuals who are educated in what harm foods can do to themselves. 

Maybe I’m ignorant but as an American, I only just this week learned that many dyes are banned/illegal in other parts of the world. 

So I began researching and discovered the possible adverse health effects artificial dyes can cause. I haven’t been able to find much online as far as if it’s a common thing people try to avoid, or how great the risk really is. As a mom of 2 young kids, I know I can’t be perfect and shield them from all risks of cancer and other health issues but I do want to try my best to offer them the cleanest, healthiest foods available to them without too much stress. Is it worth the stress to cut the dye? I started looking in my kitchen and realized it’s in so much!! Even things that aren’t even red, plain potato chips… red 40… like why???"

There's so many reasons a person could not be vegan a big one I see is price, a good example where I live milk is like $2 a gallon however plant based milk is $4-6 for a half gallon. Instead of calling these people murderers why not encourage them to eat less meat possibly from sources that don't do factory farming,  it saves more animals and doesn't immediately make them not wanna hear your opinion."

vegan,Esoteric thoughts on heart disease,"The heart was regarded in Ancient Egypt as the organic motor of the body and also the seat of intelligence, an important religious and spiritual symbol. It was considered as one of the eight parts of human body. Counter to other organs it had to be kept carefully intact in the mummy to ensure its eternal life. The Egyptians believed that the heart, rather than the brain, was the source of human wisdom, as well as emotions, memory, the soul and the personality itself.

The number one killer in our World today is heart disease. What if we can interpret this symbolically as a external result of us not leading with our hearts.
Think about the billions of people not using their heart when they engage in eating animals. The cruelty that goes behind it, is something that is conflicting in the many hearts of meat eaters. Numerous studies link consumption of red meat with heart disease.

While I'm not religious, I find it interesting that in Christian theology, Christ points to the heart with one hand and to the heavens with another hand indicating that only through the goodness of our heart can we ascend. 

""And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.”
― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

vegan,Any Vegans Work Offshore or Anyone Able to Offer Some Advice,"Hopefully this doesn't fall into the over-asked bracket.

I work offshore in the UK.  I'm vegan at home and have had to settle with being vegetarian whilst at work (the cooks there cook for &gt;150 people so catering for an individuals needs isn't often done).

I'm quite keen to be vegan at work too though.

I can't cook at work (not allowed - health &amp; safety etc) - generally includes microwave as well - so I've been looking at instant meals (i.e. camping meals that just need hot water added) but it's so expensive!!  I'd be looking at over £200 for a fortnight's worth of meals (which is brutal since being fed at work is considered part of the terms &amp; conditions).

So...

Can anyone offer any insight into how they've managed in a similar work environment?

Or what about DIY one pot meals that are made by just adding boiling water and leaving to soak for a wee bit - anyone offer insight into stuff like that?

Many thanks!"

vegan,Living as a vegan in such an non-vegan world. How do you cope (relationship-wise)?,"I’ve been a vegetarian ever since I found out what meat was (~kindergarten) and a vegan since my early teens. No family members are vegan or vegetarian. 

The entire concept of eating animals/animal products has always seemed super, super horrible and insane to me, so I’ve always felt like an oddball amongst really everyone. It felt as though something in my brain was wired differently. I don’t even think I was sure what a “vegetarian” was at age 5, but I just stopped eating meat since I knew it meant an animal dying. 

Anyway, to get to my point, I’m clearly very passionate about this since it’s such a clear right and wrong. There is no gray area in this. You can survive without torturing, killing, and eating animals, why wouldn’t you? It just does not make sense. 

Which is why I came here for advice to see how other people cope with this. It’s so difficult (especially in the last several years) to maintain any relationships with anyone without arguing about this (if they’re family), or to get close to people who aren’t vegan. I know of several otherwise really kind people who aren’t vegan and it really gets to me that they just don’t see this how I do. Why would anyone support this cruel industry? Have these people no heart for any species other than human-kind? I just generally do not understand. I’ve told this to my own mom for years and she continues to eat animal products. It truly depresses me. 

I always think about this, but more so since Roe was overturned. I’ve been seeing (non-vegans) furious about taking away an individuals right to their body (as they should be), but animal bodies are exploited by the second and not one of them blinks an eye. 

My heart is broken about this subject and it’s becoming increasingly difficult for me to deal with this. Any and all advice would be appreciated."

I feel as if there’s nothing i can eat, and i felt the same way way before i stopped eating animals, I just don’t really know how to properly eat and have meals, or cook at all, and because of that, added that most fast alternatives to a “healthy” diet that i used to consume are not vegan, i feel left out. And i know that’s not true and i’m just being ignorant like those people that say… “but where do you get your protein from” i just don’t know what to look into, so i’m looking for some recommendations and help to improve the variety in my diet. However, no matter how bored i get of eating spinach, vegan burgers and violife cheese, i will not consume anything that comes from animal cruelty ever again."

vegan,I don't understand how people buy into milk propaganda,"I'm completely open to be proven wrong here, but here are some things I've been thinking about recently:

Our bodies are wonderful things that can extract nutrients from almost anything. You get protein from legumes, beans, vegetables. You get iron from legumes, beans, vegetables. You can get all sorts of these things. But you can also get calcium from these things.

In fact, there is more calcium in kale than in milk.

So why are we sold the lie that children *need* to drink the milk of another being? Let's think about this.

If children NEEDED to drink cows milk in order to grow up big and strong, like the adverts say, why is this milk found in another living being, produced ONLY to give to their young?

There's something that humans *do* have which is even better than cow milk, breast milk.

There's absolutely no reason for a child or, especially, an adult to drink milk because it's simply unnecessary. As I said before, kale is one of the many foods that have more calcium than cow milk does, and it comes with a wider range of nutrients without the cholesterol, saturated fats or dairy that milk has. Dairy has been linked with increased risks of cancers including breast, ovarian and prostate cancer.

All of this points to why we shouldn't drink milk. But the most important part of all is the fact that milk is a product of raping a living being, stealing that being's baby from them, to then forcibly extract the milk using a machine and, once they reach the ripe old age of six (out of a possible twenty years of life) they are kil- I mean processed.

Yet, even doctors still perpetuate this lie that children *need* cow milk. There's absolutely no reason why a human being, especially one that lives in this modern age, would need to consume milk produced only for that being's young. It is unnecessary for humans to consume milk because it is not produced for us. Everything we need can be found in non-animal products.

I understand that corporations that profit from meat and dairy need to perpetuate this lie, but seeing doctors keep repeat this same point is just sad. It's time people actually started learning that eggs, milk and meat are an unnecessary part of our society. They're not healthy and people need to stop addressing them like they are healthy."

vegan,What was the final decision that made you become a vegan?,"I had already been a vegetarian for three years before I decided to become vegan. One day I was browsing this subreddit and I saw a comment about how “vegetarians claim they love animals and animal rights while eating an egg and cheese bagel every morning.” Oh god how the guilt hit me, as *I* had eaten an egg and cheese bagel that morning. I watched some videos of egg and dairy factory farms, felt repulsed and disgusted with myself, and threw away all the eggs and cheese from my fridge instantly. I have been a vegan for three years since, still upset at how I continuously ate egg and cheese bagels every morning for three years while vegetarian. Vegetarianism was the inevitable segue to ultimately becoming vegan so I don’t regret it, but this subreddit pointed out how hypocritical my views were, and that’s why I made the switch.

vegan,Me going vegan made my mom cry,"I am 17 and live with my family. I've been vegetarian for about a year now and started cutting down dairy and egg consumption a few months ago. My family has been very supportive thought-out, even though they still eat meat occasionally.

I finnaly decided to go full on vegan, due to animal rights and learning about the reality of animal agriculture. I had expected some resistance from my family, but not this. My mom told me that I was selfish for not considering how impractical it would be for the rest of the family and that no one would want to invite me to dinner parties. She also compared veganism to an eating disorder and told me that I wouldn't get enough nutrients. She wouldn't listen to scientific evidence that said otherwise. I also tried to inform about the ethics and environmental impact of the farm industry, but she just interrupted me and said that I was extreme and that she wouldn't accept my decision. Eventually she started screaming and sobbing. After that any further discussion was made impossible and we became silent. She made me feel so guilty.

I don't know what to do. I think that vegananism is the only moral option, but without the support of my family it's very hard, and i probably won't be moving out for at least two years. I also don't want to cut off my relationship with my parents. I love them and care about them, but I simulationiosly hate them for not respecting my lifestyle.

I was talking to someone about veganism and animals and said basically that I don’t care whether the animal was factory farmed or family-farmed or pasture raised or had a good life, my issue is that someone dies. And they stopped me and said, “But animals aren’t someone. They’re animals.”

I looked at my companion animal and was like, “Well… he’s someone. He has a personality. There’s someone in there having an experience.”

Because of course there is! But it just baffled me. I forget that some people don’t view non-human animals in the same way I do. What would you say?"
vegan,Praying Mantis Egg Sacs?,"My husband and I went vegan almost exactly a year ago (July 1st), and we are loving the lifestyle. There's still a lot we're learning as we go along.

I was just reading an article about how using any kind of animal fertilizer wasn't vegan, which is something I hadn't even thought about, although of course I see the point.

We have an organic garden (no fertilizers, no pesticides, etc) where we produce mostly berries and a scant amount of veggies every year. Not wanting to use pesticides, obviously we wage a seasonal war on garden pests (squash bugs are my mortal enemy).

The way we've been combatting this is by buying praying mantis eggs every year and allowing them to hatch in the garden. Seeing the tiny babies (and later, the giant adults) throughout the garden has been amazing, and we're now getting to the point where the population has become mostly settled in (we have just enough that they are laying their own eggs, and we don't necessarily need to supplement them by buying new ones.)

I know there's no ""hard and fast"" rulebook, but I'm curious if others would consider this practice particularly vegan in nature (mantises DO occur naturally here, but with the climate being what it is we tend to see less of them than before, much like lightning bugs).

We also cultivate a natural habitat to encourage them (and native pollinators) to gather and set up house, but I guess my question is strictly about artificially ""seeding"" the garden with pest-munching insects."
vegan,vegan and pro choice,"Please don't flame me, I'm not here to be uncivil, just feeling a bit conflicted with my morals. I don't believe the government should be able to inflict their religion based views upon us all and try to take a woman's autonomy. I recognize there are a ton of complicated and perfectly valid reasons why someone might chose to have an abortion. I just want to make sure I'm staying logically and morally consistent. 
When meat eaters say its a personal choice I feel their personal choice ends when there is a victim involved. Could the same argument be applied to abortion? How do we morally justify it? I would think it depends on what stage of pregnancy the woman is in and at what point sentience begins but I could be wrong.

Again I'm here with an open mind just seeking further understanding. If I'm wrong about something I'm prepared to be wrong and reevaluate."
vegan,I’m at the Renaissance festival and holy shit why didn’t I decline this?,"It’s my first time ever and it’s my last. They have jousting, leather everywhere and a lot of exotic meats— it’s barbaric and I’m crying. I don’t want to come back. I’m just so angry at myself for being this naive. Horse riding and using animals as entertainment… it’s just heartbreaking. I need hugs"
vegan,"Where to go from ""The most environmentally sound thing a person can do is...""","I argue that the best thing an individual can do for the environment is go Vegan. But then some one always comes along to say ""Well actually it's to not have any babies"" and that begs the question, how do you usually respond to that? I think it's crazy to ask folks not to have children, but there's no questioning the ecological footprint a whole other person has."
vegan,Ideal dinner plans for the week,"I've been planning my weeks for years but I feel like my plans like diversity or need an excessive amount of time to be prepared.

Searching the internet, I struggle to find meal plans which don't require a thousand ingredients or take forever when you're tired in the evening.

Do you know of any great dinner plans which are speedy &amp; which ingredients can easily be found in Europe? Thank you."
vegan,anyone else get sad about killing ants?,"the other day my friend was in my kitchen with me and she saw that we had a good amount of ants in the sink and asked if she could spray them down the drain and i was saying “that’s not really necessary because you aren’t using the sink and they’re not gonna just go away like that” yknow, and then later she went to put a bowl in the sink and proceeded to take the spray thing off of the faucet and spray all of the ants down the drain and turn on the grinder. i didn’t say anything about it because i don’t want to be an “annoying vegan that cares about ants” but it really did make me sad!"
vegan,"I ate a wonderful vegan cheese but I don’t know what brand it was, could you please help me identify it?","I just came back from a work trip and my company is very inclusive and thoughtful in many aspects one of them being catering to dietary needs whether allergies/intolerances or lifestyles. I asked the chef if they had any vegan cheese and they did. It was shredded, not a thick shred but more on the thinner side, it was a yellow cheddar, it melted pretty well, it wasn’t chalky or have weird textures, it had the usual slight chew that melted vegan cheese can have. 

I’ve had Violife but it didn’t look or taste that good (best cream cheese though!). I’ve avoided Daiya since forever just because of the bad reviews it gets but I’m wondering if that could be it after looking at some pictures online. 

I asked the chef if he knew the brand of the vegan cheese and he said he wouldn’t be able to tell me as their ingredients come in cardboard boxes w/only the nutrition and ingredient labels. 

If anything what is your favorite shredded vegan cheddar cheese that melts well?

Thank you 💛💛"
vegan,A little rant and seeking advice for dealing with family,"Hi! I went vegan around 5 months ago and I absolutely love everything that it has done to me. I feel better, I eat better and I am overall much happier. I was bulimic when I first started the diet and I haven't thrown up a single meal since going vegan since I don't feel an ounce of guilt about the food I consume. 

However, I recently had to move back to my family home as I'm in that weird limbo after graduating college where you don't know what to do with your life. They have been horrible adapting to this change, constantly telling me that I'm wrong for making such a ""drastic"" decision. They tell me during every single meal to go back to eating meat or at least to become a vegetarian. They say I'm ""forcing them"" to adapt to my new lifestyle when literally all I do is buy and make my own food and sit down eating it quietly whilst they keep going on and on about how great their beefy burgers are, how much I probably miss the taste of meat, offering me their food and then being like ""oh right, you're weird now""... It's so exhausting. I get a minimum of 10 comments of these a day and I might respond to them once a week but whenever I do, I don't see the end of it. They called me every name in the book because they each had an entire cooked cod in front of them (we're talking eyes, head, the whole shebang) and I couldn't bring myself to look at their plates. They're calling me a radical, saying I have no empathy for normal people or the ""natural food chain"", that I believe I am morally superior because I don't eat animals... I'm basically made to feel like the shittiest person in the world because I'm vegan. 

If anyone else is in this situation, how do you deal with it? I'm going through the toughest time and this is the second breakdown I've had over the situation this month. I just wanna be respected."
vegan,How should I celebrate a decade of veganism?,"The title says is all really. This year on Thanksgiving I will cross the 10 year mark. I need some frugal-ish ideas on how to celebrate. I’m giving myself lots of time to plan.

Here’s some factors that might help guide suggestions:

- I’m saving my money up for patenting a couple inventions I’ve made so money is tight.

- I am hearing impaired and don’t like large crowds or loud music.

- My wife is also vegan but isn’t quite at the 10-year mark.

- I am a proud dog-dad of three large vegan dogs."
vegan,First Time vegan,"Hey all! I've decided that I want to fully commit to a vegan lifestyle. That means clothes, food, and hygiene products. I was pescatarian for 2 years but went back to meat when I was pregnant with my son. I see a lot of my favorite influencers and celebrities who were dedicated to the lifestyle are no longer vegan (Ari G). Can you guys tell me where to start, or what to read? Things such as what vitamins to take or where to get my vitamin D and protein from ?"
vegan,Easy things to batch cook? (see post),"Hello all,

My friend is currently pregnant and before she's due I'd like to prep her some meals for when baby is here (she knows I plan to do this). 

Before she fell pregnant she was flitting between veganism and vegetarianism. Apart from dal I have no idea what else I can make for her that's vegan that can be frozen.

Any help or signposting will be most helpful. Thank you."
vegan,are tractors vegan?,"Having watched the way they churn up wildlife, I have my own opinion. Having watched families care for bullock, and work with them, I also have my own opinions about the relative ethical implications of that. I thought I'd try another nuanced discussion about something related to vegan ethics, after my last post was removed.

Sigh."
vegan,A question i wanted to ask for a while since it is not answered on the Internet...,"So as we know, fishes themselves do not produce omega 3 but rather obtain it by eating algaes, seaweeds (huge misconception that is embedded to everyone). My question is, where do the carnivorous fishes get their omega 3 from? Some ""experts"" say they don't eat algaes and seaweeds, so if that is the case, do they obtain it from eating the fishes which consume the seaweeds and algaes? My knowledge with this isn't the best, sorry about that."
vegan,"sooo, what's the consensus on abortion, I wonder?","I just realized how interesting it might be to talk about the issue, in a place where people have a baseline consideration for the life of creatures deemed unconscious by the society currently engaged in this dialogue?

Of course, I could see how this could go very wrong also, and even be deemed off topic. I think that would be narrow minded personally fwiw."
vegan,I’m never ordering from an omni restaurant again,"Just realized halfway through eating the food we ordered wasn’t vegan, even though the ordering app have a vegan toggle, because they use butter for rice and their “rice with veggies” contained cheese. We only realized after checking the allergens on their website because they couldn’t been bothered to put that info in the app too. I feel so disgusted, after 3.5 years of rigorously checking ingredients and labels I ingested something that came from an animal. 😖😭 that being said I’m only ordering from 100% vegan restaurants from now on and I’m not gonna make any exception on work lunches either."
vegan,Remain positive...,"I've seen a lot of negative posts on here about people feeling down, which is valid  


However: Veganism is constantly on the rise, with no sign of slowing down soon  


There are more plant based milks available than ever before, soya, almond, coconut, oat, hemp, potato, hazelnut etc  


There are more vegan stalls being set up  


Vegan campout has already sold out maximum amount of tickets for VCO in a few weeks  


There are more sanctuaries that are being set up to help the animals  


The dairy industry is on the decline and getting beyond desperate  


More and more people are becoming aware of the horrors of the meat, dairy and egg industry etc  


There are a number of Vegan YouTubers, Joey Carbstrong has 144k subs, Ed Winters has 431k  


Yes there is still such a long way to go but we are getting there!

vegan,just a little rant,"I just wanted a little rant on here.
I just watched the new jurassic World and it has been one of my favourite franchises ever but one of the opening scenes upset me.

SPOILER FOR THE START OF THE MOVIE:

so a group of people break into a breeding facility where they are keeping all the dinosaurs locked up in cages not big enough for them to move. Then one of the characters, Claire stated that this was medieval and disgusting. However this is exactly how animals are kept in both the meet and dairy industry, in tiny cages unable to move. 

I turned to my friend and whispered this to them and they acted surprised? are people this uneducated about how animals are kept that they think keeping animals in tiny  cages unable to move is medieval? it is happening right now."

vegan,What do you expect to happen,"Ok I have a question about cows and chckens anything in the farm yard basicly let’s say you win the war on animal products what do you expect to happen to all the animals ?

you can’t set them free it would ruin our eco system. 

The dirty little secret is if you won your war on anamal products they would just be culled.

They would serve no use and you cant just set them free."
vegan,Ethical dilemma re: a second-hand wool sweater...,"I bought a sweater second hand from an online consignment company that was listed as 100% cotton. The sweater arrives and then tag says it's 30% wool, 10% alpaca (the rest is nylon and elastane). 

If I return it, the company will know it's made with wool and alpaca and will sell it as such (where currently, they believe they made money from a cotton sweater).

If I keep it, is it likely that anyone would be able to tell what is made of? Maybe I'll just give it to my mom?"
vegan,Outraged by SCOTUS yet still buying milk. What does it take to overcome cognitive dissonance?,Most people are rightfully pissed off over losing their bodily autonomy. And many of them are drowning their sorrows in a cheese burger. Why is it so hard to extend bodily autonomy to everyone (even if they are delicious)? I'm honestly stunned by how powerful a hold cognitive dissonance has on people.
vegan,A conversation with the local beef farmer that lives down the road from us,"I'm vegan, but my family is not. My mom buys beef (cow) from a farm that's just down the road from our house. I went with her to pick up her beef order one day because I wanted to see the farm and the animals.

It's a picturesque family farm. A really small property, but they have about 200 cows out in the pastures. We went into the farmer's house to pick up the order, and we made small talk with him. My mom started asking him questions about what made him want to be a farmer and what it's like to have this farm.

The farmer was a young man, not older than 30 years old. He told us that he grew up on this farm, but he never wanted to be a farmer. He moved out when he was 18 years old and went to live in Florida, to study computer science at a university, but he had to drop out because he ran out of money. He tried to make it on his own for a while. He met a woman, married, and had kids. But eventually he moved back to work on the family farm because he had little education and was having trouble supporting himself. 

He told us that he really doesn't like being a farmer, and that he doesn't like taking the animals to slaughter, but he does because they have loans on the farm, he has a family, and he doesn't know how to get out.

My mom and I offered some suggestions and told him he could surely get out of the industry, somehow! But he just shrugged and said it's not in the cards for him right now. He looked exhausted, beaten-down, and sad.

It just made me realize that a lot of farmers are victims of the animal agriculture industry, too. I know someone posted here the other day about Ed Winters' new book, and how he talks about how slaughterhouses prey on people with little education and immigrants to fill those positions. This reminded me of that. 

Not saying that farmers are blameless. Of course we are humans, we always have a choice, and I'm sure he could have chosen something other than to farm these cows. But it opened my eyes to understand that many humans suffer as a result of farming animals, too. It really is in everyone's (animals/people) best interest to NOT consume animal products."
vegan,I've been vegan for 16 days!!,"I watched Dominion two weeks ago and decided to go Vegan, and today is my 16th day of the new lifestyle! I haven't budged once, and I've especially enjoyed making lentil pasta with red sauce and mushrooms and also tempeh Reuben sandwiches ❤ I have felt so much better since becoming vegan and I've been having less stomach problems.  I also feel so much happier knowing I'm helping to end animal suffering and abuse."
vegan,Tips to help with stomach burns?,I ate fully vegan for three days except when I drank some cream when I started having stomach burns during the end of the third day (I still live with my non-vegan family). I looked it up and apparently this is something that often appens with new vegans especially when they eat mostly substitutes (wich what I did)
vegan,"What if we lived in a parallel universe where instead of typical dairy, we ate human dairy?",Wouldn’t that make more sense? Like human cheese human milk for humans. But it’s so nasty to even think about. Yet it’s just normalized for people they’re so blind to it. It’s even more nastier to get them from other animals… I know it’s about the animals but even just the thought of dairy makes me want to throw up. I used to love pizza and stuff just even writing this I’m gagging right now
vegan,I work in Tescos.,"I work in a large Tescos in Glasgow and see day in day out the sheer quantity of mean that is loaded onto shelves everyday and bought by people. Some people will spend hundreds of pounds on shops that are 70-80% animal products, predominantly meat and cheese. 

It really depresses me and makes me kinda sick. 

I just want to know how other people deal with this. It feels like I am part of the distribution machine within the animal industrial complex. Essentially I am selling these products but I have no place or platform to make comment or educate people. 

This is just a rant reflecting the pent up disgust and frustration at seeing people buying thousands of pounds and hundreds and hundreds of lives worth of meat and dairy.

Idk I just want to do more ffs."
vegan,Dairy,"So (for me at least) my gripe against dairy has to deal with how factory farming is.  The forcefully impregnated cows, the fact calves are killed most of the time, and the overall trauma this puts on cows.  My question is if there is a small farm that I know for fact doesn’t abuse animals or kill them, is it okay to get milk?"
vegan,Is it worth it to avoid bone char sugar? I'm a college student and I can't afford fancy sugar.,"I don't want to pay more for sugar labeled organic/unprocessed/vegan, but I know that if I buy the cheapest store brand cane sugar it's almost certainly processed with bone char.

My question is, how harmful is it to buy cheap sugar? I know the biggest difference I'm making is not consuming dairy and eggs, so how necessary is this extra step? Also do most vegans care about the kind of sugar they buy?

Also what if I want to buy something that isn't pure sugar but has sugar in it? Sugar is in so many things... I don't want to email every company asking if the sugar they use is vegan before I eat something.

I think if it's going to be this difficult I should just give up being vegan.

Also I'm not vegan because I want to be healthier or whatever so don't comment saying I should just not add sugar to my food."
vegan,If you wouldnt watch live bullfighting you shouldnt watch this either,"There is abuse in hollywood, many popular movies have made lots of money at the expense of animals, the organizations in charge of monitoring animal abuse ignore it and lie in many cases, which isnt surprising

I personally thought everything lately is CGI or fake in some way but i was wrong, the same way i was wrong about dairy and other things  


No animals were harmed during this film, in many cases is a lie

There really is no difference in watching animals being hurt on a movie set, in the circus or being hurt in a ring with thousands of sick individuals cheering for it  


Whenever im watching something if an animal is hurt i go to google and check if it was real or fake, sometimes i cant find the information so i dont know  


If a movie stars an animal, chances are that its being abused during training and filming, if i know a movie has animals i try and google to learn if there is abuse before watching it, but that information is not always available  


Most of the movies i watch are from streaming such as Netflix, i stop watching the show or movie if there is animal abuse as i imagine Netflix collects data on the movie and will extend the contract if its viewed alot, i find another way to watch it which involves using a VPN but i wont watch it from Netflix

Yes this does indeed make the vegan lifestyle more difficult, no point in pretending it doesnt, my morals and ethics continue to grow as a vegan and while my life is more difficult i am glad to know im reducing unneeded suffering for personal pleasure  


I think there needs to be protests at theaters and film sets, most of the world probably thinks the same way i did, thinking that its all fake and cgi and i am sure many of the non vegans would be against animal abuse for entertainment purposes  


If you are in this sub and you dont really care about this or dont want to take the effort to research the TV and movies you watch, it would be safe to say you are on a plant based diet"
vegan,I don’t eat anymore,"My family work and they don’t know much about vegan food I’m only a teenager. I literally don’t eat at this point two meals a day if I’m lucky. And if I say I like them guess what’s the only thing I’m eating for the next few weeks.

I just want to go on cadets camps because I get fed properly. I don’t want to not be vegan but sometimes I go to get food and see a few pieces of veg that I can’t do much with.

I’m so tired of it and I just want to eat but I don’t know how to cook and my mum can’t stand mess so if I make any in the kitchen I’m screamed at.

vegan,My carnist friend,"(I'm using they/them for ambiguity)

Basically I have this friend who used to be vegan for nearly 3 years their parents were vegan. They always bring up how they've been vegan for like 3 weeks and then I point out an animal product they ate.... and another.... and another and it keeps happening.

My brother does the same thing. He made a joke today how he's going vegan for 5 second.... while eating meat.

I'm sick of being around people when they eat meat yet alone people making unfunny jokes or insensitive, false statements. I'm sick of the cognitive dissonance and how people don't see the problems with eating meat.

I'm also making a compulsory speech in my English class in a few weeks on veganism which I'm really looking forward to but I'm also worried about people being utterly rediculous.

I'm sick of having *literally* no vegan friends and no people who I know who are vegan"
vegan,Why don’t dog animal rescues use vegan food,"Or at the very least be vegan themselves? I love following different animal shelters and dog rescues and seeing heartwarming stories. But then it often makes me upset to see them using commercial food with animal products in it to feed the dogs. So much cognitive dissonance. What about saving the animals used to make that food? I don’t get it. Dogs are omnivores and can be perfectly healthy, if not moreso, without animal products. Some of the oldest living dogs were vegan/vegetarian."
vegan,Low-FODMAP and being vegan,"I wrote this a few days ago in r/FODMAPS as a [response to someone asking about going on a low-FODMAP diet and being vegan](https://www.reddit.com/r/FODMAPS/comments/v82z24/comment/iczmiyh/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). [Low-FODMAP](https://www.google.com/search?q=low-fodmap+diet&amp;oq=low-FODMAP+diet) is a diet that often time helps with some forms of irritable bowel syndrome (if you have stomach issues, read up about this). In [another post some folks have asked about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/vjcb7s/youre_beautiful_please_dont_stop_being_vegan_its/), so I figured copy and pasting it here would be good too, so here it is:

&gt;I've been vegan for over 15 years, and started the low-FODMAP diet about 4 years ago. I can tell you the first couple of months were terrifying and hard, but it's about the same amount of stress as when one jumps into being vegan and not knowing what things do/don't have animal products. Trust me you'll be fine and can continue being vegan, it just takes some time and you'll make mistakes along the way (just like everyone else starting on low-FODMAP). I also don't frequent this subreddit ( r/FODMAPS ) as it's mostly non-vegan recipes, but here I am today trying to figure out if shaoxing wine is low-FODMAP.  
&gt;  
&gt;For me I think the worst part has been that it's rare I find a restaurant that I can eat at (and dealing with the social game when out with friends), but I've been doing the vegan thing for so long it just feels like I'm back to the first few years where the vegan food offerings were few and far between. The terrible/nice thing about being low-FODMAP is, unlike being vegan, if you make a mistake or decide to cheat, the only price you pay is how negatively your gut reacts, and not going into an existential crisis questioning your ethics.  
&gt;  
&gt;I get plenty of protein through tofu and tempeh, no setan though (which rules out a lot of generic vegan imitation meats). A single patty of Impossible Meat (if you consider that vegan and are comfortable with it) I can totally tolerate (Beyond Meat is no good). You will miss most vegan spreadable cheeses since they're all cashew based (Miyoko's) but ones like Chau and Violife are good. Store bought hummus is out sadly. Anything made by Foddy (Amazon) is vegan, but avoid the dressings and the oils, they just taste off. You can find garlic infused olive oil almost anywhere. Asafoetida (Amazon), green onions (just the green parts), chive stems, garlic scapes (Asian grocery store) will become your friends. Almond based Kite Hill plain cream cheese and plain unsweetened yogurt my stomach can tolerate. Oatly milk and ice cream are good. Gluten free Oreos are remarkably low-FODMAP. Annie's has a vegan gluten free boxed mac and cheese that brings back Kraft memories.   
&gt;  
&gt;If you live somewhere that produces real legitimate sourdough bread (I'm from San Francisco), test out a slice from a bagged cut loaf that doesn't have flour caked to it and see how it affects you. The slow rise process kills off a lot of the bad carbs but depending on your flavor of IBS it might not be enough for you. If that doesn't work or you can't source good sourdough, check out Bread Srsly, pricey but super delicious.   
&gt;  
&gt;The vegan low-FODMAP book was sort of useful when I started this process, but only in so that it prevented me from hitting high stress by not knowing what I can eat, sort of like a safety blanket. A lot of the recipes are basically salads or just bland to all hell, super depressing.   
&gt;  
&gt;Just like being a normal vegan, ask your doctor to check your vitamin levels and incorporate supplements as needed into your meal schedule. Be careful though as many supplements (and over the counter medications) have added fake sweeteners and will mess up your stomach more than accidentally eating some FODMAP food. I've had good luck with Thorne.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you ever need help or have questions feel free to DM me (or any other future vegans who finds this comment through a search). We all gotta stick together and help each other out. Good luck."
vegan,Embryos now have the right to life in several states before fully developed and sentient animals. How can people fight so vigorously for the rights of an undeveloped sack of cells while also paying others to slaughter animals that kick and scream to avoid death for a burger?,"I occasionally hear people call vegans that support abortion hypocrites because they apparently value animal life over humans. Sentience is the quality we look at in determining if someone is an individual deserving of rights. I do not know where the line of sentience is in human development but it makes sense to me that it would be near the point of viability. No matter where it is, it is such a shame to see the line drawn at the point of conception with no evidence of the ability to perceive subjective experiences when farm animals have no meaningful legal protections. If your definition of sentience includes a sack of undeveloped cells, then animals that play when happy and scream when hurt should fall well within those guidelines. Supporting a total ban on all abortions while actively supporting the slaughter of sentient animals daily is as hypocritical as it gets."
vegan,NYC Vegan Recommendations (Central Park South),"Hello! I will be visiting NYC in a few weeks. I am from a very rural area so I'm excited to finally have options when I dine out. What are your favorite spots near Central Park South/ Midtown East? I don't mind walking though. I'm most excited about bakeries, but will definitely need Lunch and Dinner options as well.

Thank you!"
vegan,I will officially be vegan tomorrow.,"Now that I have SNAP benefits, I’ve officially run out of excuses to go vegan, which is something I’ve been eying from the sidelines for years but haven’t felt quite ready to jump into until now. I’ve got my first batch of groceries, and so far I actually already feel like I’m transitioning well so far. I’m eating a meat meal that my dad offered me for lunch, but he understands that this is the last time I’ll be consuming animal products."
vegan,"Is the new ""Jurassic World: Dominion"" movie vegan?","To all who have seen the final edition of the Jurassic series, did you find an underlying vegan message? I thought the point was that, as a species, we would have to learn how to live in peace with all creatures. Of course, we don't have dinos to worry about, but the film put humans on a similar level as the prehistoric animals, demonstrating that both deserved species to flourish on Earth. In the end scene, various herds of elephants, birds, and dinosaurs paraded together across the fields. Also, the title. Dominion. We need to share the planet, acknowledge and respect the other animals that live here, and quit needlessly harming them for our own primal desires. To be fair, some meat was eaten in the movie, but you get the point. I would've flaired this under wildlife because I love dinosaurs (always have, even as an adult, don't judge me please!) but I summoned some maturity instead and decided upon ""discussion."""
vegan,Dizzy spells?,"Recently I’ve had random dizzy spells. Starts with a hot flash, so I know it’s coming and then my vision goes fuzzy for a couple seconds. 
First time happened at my new job, chalked it up to nerves and information overload. Second and third time, just figured I didn’t eat enough during the day. I do have to premise that I drink SF Red Bull every day (already working on weening myself off now). Last 2 dizzy spells, I was driving on the freeway. Which is terrifying. 
Blood work is fine, only B12 and Vit D low, been taking additional supplements on top of daily Vit. Haven’t asked my doctor yet because I’m avoiding the “it’s your diet” bullshit. Just want to get it under control 🤷‍♀️

vegan,“Slime” at the bottom of my almond milk?,"hey guys, so I’ve been trying vegan alternatives recently and I bought a califia brand almond/coconut milk bottle. when I poured some into a cup I noticed that at the bottom there seemed to be a slime material. Did my milk go bad? I’m confused as to how since I had just bought it. I heard separation occurs but I don’t feel comfy drinking it until I know for sure. Sorry if this doesn’t really fit the sub I didn’t know where else to post.

thanks!"
vegan,Can y’all help me save some squirrels?,"My friend has started having problems with the squirrels around his house. It started when his trash can lid broke off, the squirrels started getting into the trash and dragging it out all around the ground. They started getting into more things after that. They ate a hole through his cooler, somehow pulled his car window down, ate things and left a mess inside, and are generally just tearing shit up.

He wants to shoot them. I talked him down and he set up a trap instead and relocated one squirrel. After doing some research I see that the squirrel will either come back or die. I told him and he doesn’t care, he just wants them to stop doing what they’re doing. He said if I want to do something to keep them away I can but he’s still setting up the trap incase it doesn’t work.

What can I do and what is the fastest thing I can do to save them?"
vegan,adjusting to a vegan diet,"I was vegetarian for 10 years, randomly switched to omnivore for a few weeks, then felt guilty and went cold turkey (for lack of better word) vegan.

vegan,Phosphorus help,"Hi, I've been eating whole food plant based for a few months now and I'm about 90 percent compliant. I generally hit all the targets on cronometer so thought I would be OK. But I've just had a call from my doctor saying that I have low phosphate/phosporus. They have ordered some more blood tests Inc vit d levels. I'm hitting the 700mg minimum nearly every day.

Has anyone ever dealt with this before and any ideas what I can do to help it? I don't want to suppliment yet as apparently too much can be dangerous too.

I eat lots of beans and pulses and lots of nutritional yeast which are apparently goos sources of it."

As of right now though, I'm kind of tired of foods that are heavily reliant on animal-replacement components.

vegan,Christmas dinner.,"My sister in law who lives in a different country is coming to our city for Christmas but her husband insists on eating turkey on that day. 
She usually buys her own pre cooked prawns when she’s here. 
I went so far as to say while they were staying with us that he ( who lives to cook) could prepare himself turkey in my house and I’ll do our our vegan  food separately. 
(For the sake of sharing this which might be my mother in laws last family Christmas. She’s unwell).

 Just found out they will be spending Christmas Day with their friends in our city and staying in serviced apartments. 
Tbh it’s probably for the best but it’s a shame for my mother in law, especially as her birthday is Christmas Day too. 
I feel like I extended myself with the offer for them to cook meat in my oven but it’s clearly not enough. 
I’m a bit taken aback. 
Maybe I’m being over sensitive. 
What do you think?"
vegan,why is raising vegan children considered cruel?,"to me, nothing is more cruel than lying or misleading children into believing animal meat is not what it actually is, or even necessary to be healthy or “normal”. kids are the most compassionate beings, and i can’t imagine anything more compassionate than teaching children that all life is sacred and has inherent value. i also feel like people forget that children can be malnourished on any diet, not just a plant-based diet. why do people respond so negatively towards perfectly healthy vegan children and their parents?"
vegan,Vegan in a cattle ranching state -- how do I deal with the pain of seeing beef-raised cattle everywhere I go?,"I've been fully vegan for about a month now, so the pain of how my lifestyle in the past has harmed animals is still really fresh.

I live in the US in a state where cattle outnumber people. I work in weed management, so I've spent my week going out to BLM land (where cattle are allowed to graze) to monitor herbicide effectiveness. I see cattle every damn day at work. It breaks my heart every time I see them because I know what their fate is, and that there's nothing I can do to stand in the way of that fate. I watched free ranging cattle get herded into tiny corrals, then get loaded on to trucks and it's all I could do to keep from crying in front of my boss. Even if I were to leave my job, I'd still see cattle everywhere I go and I'll probably get stuck driving behind a cattle trailer within a week.

Plus, raising cattle in the habitat where I work is killing the native plants. Cattle don't eat the invasive species, so they eat the good grasses leaving plenty of room for invasive species to take over. It's incredibly frustrating.

How do I live with this constant reminder that most people care more about their hamburger than the lives of these cattle who never chose this? Are there any organizations out there that stand up against cattle ranching?"
vegan,Working in a place that sells food is awful.,"I know this is just an obvious statement because having to be around corpses is obviously upsetting but I'm just struggling to not feel completely doomed.
Selling body parts to people is bad enough, knowing they dont even care, but the worst part is knowing all of the food that gets wasted. All of the torture and slaughter done for absolutely nothing. Our planet is being killed by us and not only are people continuing to be complicit in this world of suffering but we're not even getting anything out of the pain and damage we're causing. Part of my job is to check expiration dates and throw out things that expire even though a lot of it is probably still fine. Dairy obviously goes bad pretty quick but cookies and energy bars and chips ect are reasonably fine for a bit past their dates but we just throw them all away. I can't even buy things just to donate them since 1. That would be a lot of money on things I cant even use and 2. Food banks dont want to take expired food for obvious reasons.

I just felt the need to share how I'm feeling with other people who understand how bad of a shape we're in. It's really just another drop in the bucket of death ig."
vegan,"Do you have a favorite vegan, low or zero waste makeup brand?","I'm looking to abandon ELF and Nyx, I keep getting bad brushes and chunky products from them. I'd like something relatively low waste (refillable, compostable packaging, etc) and preferably a smaller business. Lower price is good, but not super necessary if the products are worth it. I specifically would like to replace my eyeliner, mascara, and eyeshadows, maybe even blush."
vegan,how do you meet fellow vegans if you are unable to do activism?,"Since i became vegan about 7 years ago i did a lot of activism and was quite active in the community, but i have been struggling with depression for a while and cant handle the negativity that carni-/omnivores show towards such events at the moment.

I could really use the company and companionship provided by fellow vegans, so where do i find them when I'm not strong enough to join the fight on the streets right now?

Thanks in advance!"
vegan,How the should one react when ones partner disses veganism?,"My girlfriend sometimes says random things about veganism not containing enough nutrients, her not believing that children can grow up on a vegan diet etc. 

I say hell no, show her the science from official corporations and she's like ""nah I don't believe it."" For whatever reason: if I show her an example vegan-from-birth people she'll be like ""nah they rich so obviously then it's possible"", if I show her what the Swedish National Food Administration has to say about it then it's the Swedes not being reliable enough for whatever reason. 

This obviously doesn't happen all of the time, but it's annoying because I'm used to being the one giving up in an argument so I have a hard time standing my ground and one day I could end up agreeing with her and going vegetarian or something.

I had a hard enough time convincing her hens lay unfertilized eggs, this is a nightmare."
vegan,Blood tests,"Sharing because I’m so pleased with myself!
I’ve been vegan for just over 2 years and for the first time in my life, all of my bloods came back normal! When I had blood tests prior to going vegan, I was always deficient in something 🤗 I’m fully armed for the next time somebody tells me human beings NEED to eat animal products to be healthy. Yay!"
vegan,Serious questions: Has anyone ever challenged a carnivorous sushi lover to eat a fish while it's still alive? Or to eat an omelette while watching baby male chicks get put through a meat grinder? Or to drink a milkshake while watching a newborn calf get euthanized?,"I believe we need more of these tactics. We need to find a way to look the carnivorous ""animal lovers"" in the eye and say to their face, ""BULLSHIT! PROVE IT!"" I know this is aggressive and much of the vegan community is against aggression, but in my opinion, this method could shed light on how evil and inhumane the meat industry is, rather than portray he vegan community as aggressive. There has to be a way to challenge people and shake some sense into them!"
vegan,"You're beautiful, please don't stop being vegan, it's more important than imploring others to change.","I went vegan in 2005. Many of my friends (let's say about 20ish people) at the time were vegan, they all encouraged me to try going vegetarian for a month and see how that impacted my day to day health I was having issues of feeling very sluggish and tired after consuming a meal's worth of meat. Once I saw improvement by switching to plants I also realized I was lactose intolerant and I already hated eggs, so I basically jumped into following a vegan diet for free. After a few months I learned about what animal cruelty was and how veganism is actually about consent. Toss in the eco impact of meat farming, I was in.

I wanted a better future for not only me but every animal. I no longer wanted my body to be a tomb for others. And having a community of close friends who also followed that creed made it feel like this is acceptable and doable even though everyone else around me gave me flack and doubt.

17 years later, almost all of my friends from that era now consume animal products in on one form or another. Come in the name of needing protein or some other nutrients for their body (and I'm sure some of them are actually healthier now than when they were vegan and not putting in effort at watching what they eat). Of course comes the justifications that it's free range or that it's only fish, and harvesting eggs doesn't hurt the chickens, which I can tell you has gotten communicated harder to me than random people doing the ""oh you're vegan, let me self justify how I'm not and that it's ok."" Also I've been told that real leather boots are so worth it, that it makes it ok.

All of the people I looked up to at the beginning thinking they're doing this really hard thing so well and I can do it too, stopped. I felt alone and it was fucking depressing.

4 years ago I was diagnosed with a form of IBS that forced me to switch over a [low-FODMAP diet](https://www.google.com/search?q=low-fodmap+diet&amp;oq=low-FODMAP+diet). My gastrointestinal recommended I drop the vegan constraint because I wouldn't be able to get the nutrients I need. Friends kept on asking me how could I ever continue being vegan. The first month felt impossible, I skipped work a bunch because I was panicking over what could I ever eat? It was like going vegan in 2005 and not knowing what products were ok and which ones weren't (pro-tip, with low-FODMAP no products are ok). I needed to make it work, the code of veganism was important to me, and so I pushed through. What I eat now is bland, boring, repetitive, and gluten free bread tastes like baked cardboard, but I need to do it because there is no other reasonable option for me and my values.

17 years later I'm left with only four extremely close vegan friends that I value dearly. And I'm also left with my vegan self.

From day one to today, for how vocal I've been to friends, family, and strangers to go vegan, not a single carnivore has changed (outside of trying a vegan diet for a month or two).

The biggest impact I've made after 17 years has been to remain vegan, and I'm going to take this to my grave.

Many of you reading this will at some point stop being vegan, and to you today that thought would seem inconceivable. Some of you who may label yourselves as the most extreme vocal about how your friends/family/strangers should go vegan, will stop being vegan in the future. It just happens, it's life, it's your choice, and I'm not judging you. I'm not going to use my experience as a statistic, but the conclusion I've hit for myself is:

**It's more important to have one of your main focuses in life be staying vegan, over making it top tier number priority to help others make the change to veganism.**

You're beautiful, please don't stop being vegan."

vegan,"Am scheduled to give a conference talk on supporting youth vegans Saturday, having to pull out","I came up positive for covid yesterday. Second positive today. Will have to pull out of the conference which is Saturday. First time I've caught it all pandemic. 

I was SO nervous and excited to give this talk. It was going to be a research based discussion on childhood vegans and vegetarians and how the adults in their lives can support them as they navigate exploring their own sense of right and wrong. I've been working on pulling this talk together since February. 

The conference organizer had to specifically get permission from the board for me to do this talk as two members of the board own beef operations and were *not* happy with the idea. The conference attendee population are also from a rural, conservative region that prides itself on its beef production/identity. I have no idea how the presentation was going to go, but I couldn't believe they even agreed to let me talk. 

The conference is for a major youth organization in the US that regularly brings kids into soaces to interact with ag animals. Parents, volunteers, and staff were going to be in attendance. I have no clue how many would have come to this particular session since I was up against 6 others in the same time slot but even if I got one person there who legitimately was interested in supporting youth to eat less or no meat, I was going to count it as a win. I was prepared to have an empty room. 

I'm just feeling kind of devestated and no one really gets why this was such a big deal for me. I was also going to do a podcast interview for this presentation but had to pull out at the last minute due to losing my grandma two weeks ago. So it's not been my month. So now I've lost both chances to hopefully reach an audience and advocate. I'm afraid since I have to pull out I won't get another chance in the future with how much they didn't want to let me be a presenter this conference."
vegan,Is halal meat ethical to eat?,"Aight so, my family is muslim(I’m agnostic but like, I’ll still whatever they eat). They’re also bengali so meat is a big part of the cuisine but all of it’s halal, so the way the animal is killed is humane and ethical, or at least should be, so it’s cruelty free.

So my question is; would halal meat be aight to eat if you’re vegan? Or is it not because you’re still killing an animal?"

vegan,Meat eating BF,"The fact my boyfriend still eats meat occasionally is driving me insane. He knows I don’t want to date someone who eats meat, a vegetarian at most, however still eats meat when he gets the option. He feels like he has to, he can’t say no, or feels like his body needs to fuel, or that the dish was “recommended” 

Idk what to do, I love him so much but can’t imagine spending my life with someone with such different morals. 

It honestly disgusts me. I can’t watch him eat it, I’m immediately infuriated. To me it isn’t a bacon sandwich, it’s a dead animal"
vegan,My wife and I are struggling.,"I've been vegan for quite a while, but my wife is a carnist. When people ask me about veganism, she always pops up and says stuff like ""I don't eat much meat"" which is quite the lie, and almost an attention grab and trying to take away from the vegan philosophy. 

Anywho, I'm the cook in the house so she tends to eat plant-based at home, but she still very much eats meat outside the house. Whenever I try to speak about veganism, I get told I'm being preachy and I don't have a right to say this kind of stuff, which I'm sure many of you  have heard before.

It's grinding on me more and more with the realisation that she's not the compassionate person I thought she was. She won't watch Dominion or any other documentary that'll go against what she wants to do, and simply does not want to listen to the fact she's eating a pig or a cow. 

We have a son, who is vegetarian as a middle ground (unfortunately), although I only give him vegan food, but this simply makes the situation more complicated.

I am going to follow veganism in few days. Basically I am waiting for my alternate foods to arrive. I was a vegetarian from birth and I really felt sad and depressed about how these Lovely animals were slaughtered mercilessly. I have cried a lot where some people just called me crazy and impractical. I had a lot of pets. Really everyone should value the love and emotions of animals. They are the purest emotions and love that one can feel/ get.  Many social platforms / people trash me for supporting veganism , Its a general trend in the internet to trash vegans ( afai noticed ).  But You guys are awesome . I love each and everyone who is trying to protect our lovely animals. This community is just great and I really really love you all. I wish I had more people like you in my everyday life . You guys are the actual great human beings   I have learnt a lot of new things from this community. My heartfelt gratitude to all the greatest souls here for your universal love and compassion. I live in a country where veganism had not picked up much ( insanely trolled tbh ) , but I will be the change I want to see. Its so comforting to see y'all , you guys have really left a positive influence in my life.  May all you guys be blessed with the best of life . Together we shall win in this process of spreading universal love ❤️."
vegan,I want to go vegan but pcos,"I want to go vegan but I have pcos and so many people on the pcos subreddit are like ""when I was on a wfpb diet my toes fell off 😔, I instantly became bald and diabetic the moment my tongue touched that tofu 😓, I gained 780 pounds😮‍💨, I went to the hospital for vitamin Z deficiency 😖, I didn't have a period for six years 😥, I woke up with a whole-ass beard one morning like Tim Allen in The Santa Clause 😢. You need to go keto 🤩 "" I would rather kill myself than convert to ketoism not only because I would have to kill animal but because it's embarassing. What do I do?"
vegan,I'm starting to wonder if lots of carnists actually don't have a sense of right/wrong,"TLDR; Do some people not feel empathy at all? Or have any sense of morals?

I was watching [this street debate about veganism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlYPEpR6E0o) that's on Earthling Ed's channel where this guy literally says, ""There is no morality unless you believe in God"" (17:40 in the video).

I watch a lot of these public debates on veganism, and I'm always baffled by the amount of times that one of these carnists says that there are no morals in nature. They literally argue that since there are no rules in nature, and it's not against the law to kill an animal, you can do whatever you want.

My ex-boyfriend was similar with me. He said stuff like, ""I know it's an animal but I just don't care."" I was like, what do you mean that you don't care? Like you don't value life at all? That someone else's suffering doesn't matter because it's not YOU suffering? 

I'm trying not to be cynical, but honestly when people say this it makes me wonder if there's just tons of sociopaths with the inability to feel empathy running around in public. If someone can't understand why it's bad to cause harm or suffering, I really don't want to be around them.

Like, I stepped on a snail a few weeks ago when I was in our yard taking my dog to the bathroom, and I really thought about the fact that I'd ended its life--literally just by accident. I thought about how we can indirectly cause suffering or pain, even if it's not our intention. It made me feel BAD. I wouldn't want to be stepped on and killed. I want to live. 

Do some people literally not do that thing where you put yourself in someone else's shoes?

It scares me that people like this exist, because if they can harm an animal and really not care, they are definitely capable of causing many other kinds of human suffering, too. You can't even talk to someone like that, because you try to make them feel empathy and they have none."
vegan,"New Vegan, Old Animal Products","I am newly vegan.

I am very fortunate insofar as my wife has elected to move to a vegan lifestyle with me, and my mother, and in-laws have decided to switch to a plant based diet. This takes a lot of pressure off family gatherings.

I also have many people in my social circle who are vegan, so this transition will be easier for me than for some.

However, while I will not be eating animal products going forward, I am grappling with what to do with those already around my house.

Persistent things like leather goods I will likely sell and donate the proceeds to a local farm sanctuary, or donate things like shoes to people in need. The harm has already been done and I have contributed to it with these purchases, and while I will not use these items myself it seems crass to dispose of them when they can be used to do some small good for a farm sanctuary or needy person.

Perishable things, like supplements with gelatin, I'll likely throw out. I won't consume them any longer. 

My other dilemma is that I have snakes. This is a tough one. They are not native species, and the reason I ended up with them in the first place is because many people keep them in poor conditions. I wanted to give them homes where they could thrive, with ample space and enrichment opportunities. They are members of the household with distinct personalities, and I would never trust another person to take care of them as I do. Many reptile keepers treat them as display pieces and do not give them the correct resources to thrive, or bother learning how they communicate. When I took them in I committed to giving them the best lives they could possibly have outside of their far off and fast diminishing native habitats. Barring unforeseen tragedy, they could all live upwards of 20 more years, some as long as 50.

Here's the issue. Snakes are obligate carnivores. There's no way to feed a snake a vegan diet, they eat frozen rats. That's it. There's no other option that wouldn't slowly kill the snakes, as they have a highly specialized digestive system.

So, I guess I am going to just feel like an asshole for the next 20 to 50 years, possibly the rest of my life since there's a not zero possibility a few of them outlive me. 

Is anyone in a similar situation? I know a few of my vegan friends have cats from their pre-vegan days and there's pretty much no vegan cat food. 

On one hand I have an obligation to provide the best possible quality of life for the animals in my care. On the other hand, doing so means providing them with animal products to eat. 

I suppose this falls under 'possible and practicable' but it still feels gross."
vegan,Questions for vegans,"I want to be vegan for the ethical aspects of it, however i have a few problems. 
1) Vegan food is expensive and taste like crap. soy milk cost another $1 more for coffee. vegan alternatives are expensive in my country and taste like complete garbage, i bought a pack of vegan cheese for $15. and it taste like shit disguised as cheese. it’s not feasible for me to live like this. i want to still continue to eat proteins(not just soy) cheap. 
2) there’s few vegan options in my country. unless i eat a $10 wrap 3 meals a day, there’s nothing i can eat for a good value outside. vegetables are stir fried with lard or minced meat, tofu has meat fried with it. 
3) meat is a BIG part of my culture. we eat every part of the animals. every. we make pig guts into a stew and it taste like heaven. we eat chicken feet, it’s tender and taste like magic. Fish is also a big part of food culture, steamed pomfret with ginger, chilli and coriander never tasted so amazing. frog porridge is immaculate, it’s spicy and tender too! I want to enjoy eating my local foods because that’s what’s cheap, available and what i grew up on. i don’t do this to appease my parents, i do it to enjoy the culture. 

also a question: if i raise my own chickens and eat their eggs is it unethical? what if i raise them in a fox proof coop and feed them top quality foods and give them time to range? is it not ethical?

i currently do meatless mondays for context. 
i don’t mean any malice, i genuinely want to find solutions to my problems."
vegan,Dating Struggles,"Hey, guys! Don't mind me, this is just more of a vent post honestly. So I'm a 20 year old girl in college, and I know I still have plenty of time, but it feels like finding a partner is an impossible task. I'm willing to date vegetarians, as long as they don't eat meat I'd be willing to give it a try. I'm also pan, so you'd think that would open me up to lots more people, but so far it has been so hard for me to try to find someone to even date. I downloaded veggly, but have had little luck so far.

Basically, what I'm asking is, do you guys have any tips on how to find someone? Or how to not feel discouraged after all the searching?"
vegan,Shame and guilt at work,"Hello, I feel very bad. I work as a courier and today I had to deliver a shipment containing honey. I have always avoided working in such places and I have lost opportunities for this reason. For a long time I lived on very little money. I currently owe money to moneylenders and credit institutions. I can't find another job for this high salary for many reasons. If I quit this job, I'll just kill myself (I was already close to that). My life depends on it and I am completely serious in what I say.  At the same time, I feel guilty as a courier to deliver shipments with honey, although rarely.  I don't know what to do. I ask for advice and assistance. Thanks in advance!"
vegan,Haunting quote I Found In Ed Winter's new(ish) book,"In the words of a former slaughterhouse worker: ""I had suicidal thoughts from the guilt. I still dream about it now and I can't look at dead animals packaged up in the supermarket. And think about this as you're tucking into a roast: you didn't hear the tortured screams of those animals. You didn't see them fight with every ounce of their strength to stay alive. You didn't clean their blood from the factory floor. I did, and the guilt will haunt me forever.""

Shouldn't be anything surprising to most here but I just thought it was a memorable quote. It's originally from some journal article. I can link it later if there's interest but I'd have to go look for it first"
vegan,What is Fructose and Fructose Intolerance?,"Fructose intolerance is a complex allergy that is not spoken about a lot. Often fructose malabsorption is confused with FODMAP or simply choosing to cut out simple sugars for health purposes. If you’re a little confused about what fructose is and what fructose malabsorption means, here’s what you need to know…

## So What Is Fructose?

Fructose is one of the three most common ‘monosaccharides’, otherwise known as ‘simple sugars’ alongside glucose and galactose. It exists naturally in fruits, fruit juices, some vegetables, and honey. However, it is often added to processed foods. It’s favoured over other simple sugars because it is sweeter, so less is required to make a product sweet.

vegan,Learned meds for rare autoimmune neurodegenerative disease has lactose in it…no other options.,"So I have a 1 in a million disease that even going to the doctor and being like “I have this” is gets me “what is that?” Or literally one dude used the code for hypochondriac in his notes because google doesn’t exist. 

Anyways. The main line treatment for this disease is a medication that contains lactose. And while I already feel really  bad  about it im conflicted. 

Am I not vegan anymore then? If I stop taking it i literally can’t walk due to severe stiffening and spasticity in my legs and one of my arms. 

So I guess this may be a bit of a debated topic and apologize but does this make me not vegan anymore? I wasn’t aware until someone not vegan wouldn’t stop talking about it and then it just made me feel more and more guilty. Like I need to walk. But now it’s like. Am I a fake vegan knowing this?

This is the mainline treatment along with IVIG if approved along with another medicine that also has lactose. It’s a very rare neurological disease. There are no alternatives because it’s one of those “we know this exists but really don’t know much more than that or how it happens and can kinda sorta treat symptoms until we can’t” sort of deals. 

Conflicted but. I guess. Am I fake? Because I know I can’t stop this medicine and without treatment or delaying treatment it’s very easy to die if you have a spasm in your chest and it’s uncontrolled because no meds."

To me these can't be considered ""meals"" anymore, I just can't believe I used to see this as real food. Super salty dead bodies, super salty potatoes, super sugary/salty cow's milk. I eat a lot of whole foods now, and I've become so accustomed to all the fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts, seeds, grains, etc. being a large part of my daily diet that I forget I am living in the midst of a carnist world full of junk food. Sure, I treat myself to a veggie pizza with vegan cheese and sausage and also coconut-milk-based ice cream once and a while, and I eat cereal with soy milk and dark chocolate every morning, but I am just baffled at how much of a lack of healthy plant-based foods even as a side dish there is. Words cannot even begin to explain this feeling. 

Perhaps this is not the case for your country. I'm talking about the US."
vegan,"Food, Solved","I recently figured out how to just put thinking about food at all completely behind you.

&amp;#x200B;

Every time you go to the grocery store, just grab one or two bags or some different kind of dried beans or seeds.

Get an instant pot.

Once a week, fill it with a random combination of beans and seeds.

(Add rice and or vegetables if you want)

30 minutes later, there is the week's food.

Don't add spices to the pot, add them to the individual bowls. 

Indian spices one day, Asian another, Mexican another, Italian another.  

It tastes fine but you never crave it for any reason than being hungry.

Costs next to nothing, and covers majority of your nutrition needs.

Maybe add some nootch to the bowl now and then for whatever you missed."
vegan,Less energy and motivation a couple years into being vegan," This doesn't seem to have been a problem at first, it's something that feels like it just built up over the time I've been vegan. I generally feel apathetic and unwilling to do anything that takes serious effort. I'm not finding much enjoyment in many things. This wasn't really a problem for me before and I took on all kinds of interesting projects and lifted weights daily. Now I feel like I have to force myself to work out even though it's substantially less weight than I used to lift. It basically is like living in a bit of a haze.

I supplement vitamin D, B12, and algae omega-3s.

Is there something else supplement-wise I could try adding? I've heard there are some nutrients that are a lot more abundant in meats that have anecdotally helped some vegans when they supplement them.

vegan,Common ingredients that you didn't realize weren't vegan.,"As someone who was gluten free for over 10 years before going vegan, I have had a lot of experience reading food labels.

vegan,A genuine question for those that criticize vegetarians,"I made a post recently about how I am vegetarian, and while interested at some point going vegan, was met with many remarks about how I dont care for animals because I am not 100% removed from the animal industry. While I never claimed to be a saint, I do feel that any measures taken are better than none and that this mindset only pushes people away from the cause. 

Regardless, I was told that I dont care for animals because sources of dairy and eggs still cause suffering in animals -- Fair enough, beyond the fact that the posters in questions came off in a manner that was very rude and demeaning and they acted as if they were completely abstaining from the suffering of animals themselves. 

This lead me to an interesting thought and the basis of this thread and Id hope that it is considered before someone act in a rather haughty matter towards those that are actively making a change. Id like to see this question considered genuinely and not be modded: 

For the Vegans that claim to not be involved in any suffering of animals and look down at vegetarians -- do you own an iphone? Do you wear any name brand clothing? Do you support corporations in any manner?

Are you aware that by owning and using these products you are contributing to the mistreatment of animals? Yes, these animals are humans. So many of the products we use in daily life are the product of slavery, often child slavery. Does this mean that you do not care about humans or animals because you are 100% free of causing harm to them?

My point being, its very important to attempt to reduce the suffering of animals and I am glad there are people out there who take the measures you all do. But to look down on vegetarains in a hateful manner and make harmful comments under the pretense we are totally absolved of the suffering of animals appears both sanctimonious, self serving, and is just factually false. Just something to consider before you make comments towards others are are actively trying to make even a small change..

vegan,Solid Supplement recommendations/advice?," 

I've googled until my brain is mush, and I've even talked to my Dad (he's an MD) about supplements/diet changes and I've gotten nowhere on a specific issue, I'm hoping some of you could point me in the right direction:

So, I've been vegan for over a decade, and vegetarian for 6 years before that, and I've always been fairly active and in decent shape (dabbled in various sports as a kid but now I mostly just work out with light weights, go hiking, etc, nothing too crazy). I've noticed that during the pandemic as my stress levels rose astronomically, I've started to get thicker (not in a good way) in my mid-section, my hair is brittle, and I NEVER feel rested/restored. I've upped my fitness regimen over the last year and still am not making progress with how I feel or how I look. Life is still quite stressful (money, school, family stuff) but this isn't a normal correlation IMHO (I've *always* had a pretty challenging life and was still able to find joy/feel quite healthy in the past). My diet has only gotten better over the years: I eat alot of produce, rice, potatoes, garbanzos, mushrooms, sea moss, and some processed vegan food as well like tofu and mock meat products. I also take Garden of Life men's multi vitamin (supposedly the best vegan vitamin on the market), and some sublingual b12 (spray and pills, not sure how effective it is).

Basically, I went to my annual check-up and got a blood panel done, and my primary care doc says that my thyroid is sluggish, my cholesterol is a bit high, and my omega 3's are extremely low. She is trying to badger me (without so much as a full conversation) into immediately taking prescription medication for the thyroid and cholesterol issue, as well as trying to get me to start taking an SSRI (I'm not depressed any more than anyone else living in this hellscape rn lol) and eating fish/taking a fish oil supplement, which obviously I would never do. I don't take any medication, I don't even drink caffeine or alcohol, and do not want to start any type of prescription that would only complicate my life/health in the long run. I want to fix these issues naturally through supplements, food, lifestyle, fitness, etc, but I read conflicting information everywhere about how to do that, even on vegan websites.

I truly want to be a stellar example of vegan health &amp; fitness, and I feel like I'm letting myself and the community (and therefore the animals) down by not inhabiting my highest self. Any advice would be **deeply** appreciated !!!"
vegan,"In a hypothetical economic crisis where there were terrible food shortages, would you ever eat non-vegan food again?","This is a question I ask out of genuine curiosity as a vegan myself. I understand that a majority of all my food comes from the grocery stores, and I just so happen to be lucky enough to live in a society that has a decent amount of vegan food. However, both of those concepts are not guaranteed to last forever. We as a society have gotten very comfortable with food being always nearby and abundant, but what happens if that changes? What happens during a crisis situation that takes the food out of grocery stores? When you have no idea where you will get tomorrow's or next week's meal? When the concept of a vegan company fades away into a past luxury we got to indulge in for a short amount of time? 

I have to ask myself these questions to know for myself what I want in life and how I should live it. I would want to know what I would do in this situation well beforehand, because I know the starving version of myself will be biased when it comes to food selection. Many organisms have an answer to this situation which would be to hunt other animals, which isn't something I have any desire to do. However, after months or potentially years of a food shortage, I know the idea would be tempting to us mortal and finite beings. 

So, I ask you, personally, how would you endure at a time like this? I could see one choosing to live the noble route, and starve if that is necessary. Or, I could see people putting veganism aside as they realized that lifestyle was best for thriving in a society, not surviving outside of it. Either way, it would be a tough decision and I want to know what other vegans would personally do in this situation. this question might be similar to the stranded island question, but I figure this one is much more realistic and something we should plan for today, whereas the idea of being lost at sea is not exactly a concern for most people. 

 alright guys thank you for reading,  I am looking forward to hearing your responses, love you guys."

vegan,Need ideas for high calorie meals to eat while bike touring.,"So I plan on bike touring soon and I need some ideas for lunch but mostly for dinner.

But when it comes to lunch and dinner I'm not really sure what to eat. I need to eat a lot, about 4000 calories a day

For lunch I'm planning on doing something simple such as sandwich with things like hummus(if I find any), olive oil, heard some used premade falafel which might work, any other ideas for easy lunch to make out on the road? I'd rather not set up my camping stove for lunch. If I do set up my stove I might make a onepot pasta.

For dinner the Ideas I have is mostly rice+legume and then add tomato sauce and spices, or soy sauce. So for example boil rice and lentils together, add tomato sauce, vegetables and spices, done. Or I might get some pre-cooked beans and add it to the rice with some spices, sort of like a fried rice. Spices I plan on bringing with my is garlicpowder, onionpowder, curry, garam masala, chili, salt, black pepper, cumin, paprika. Do you guys got any ideas for spices +  tasty and easy meals that are high calorie that I can make on a camping stove? 

I'm a type 1 diabetic, so no sugary desert stuff, and I stay away from wheat and rye if I'm not planing on working out after eating those foods. Other than that I eat most stuff."

They responded that we dont need holidays to survive, phones etc. and they cost the lives of animals so wheres the line?

I mentioned how we eat 3x a day and have alternatives that match the pleasure from food and therefore it's a moral obligation to go vegan. But I also said how humans deserve a certain level of pleasure, explaining why its okay to go on holiday every now and then. But this stumped me, cus if going away costs the life of an animal, what's to stop that person saying ""I could have a steak every now and then cus I deserve that pleasure"".

I can deal with them, scooping them up and throwing them outside.  My mom however hates them.  She's totally grossed out by them, and tries to kill them whenever possible.  She'll even move furniture to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

What's a good vegan way to get them out of my house and keep them out?  I've looked online, and nothing I saw might be good enough. Or it's only good for keeping them out, not driving them out.  I want them out of my house, for the sake of both my family and them.

vegan,Type of restaurant you can tolerate,"Which of the following restaurant options is the lowest level you would eat from? (Explain your choice below)

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/vhwkxv)"
vegan,"Be brutally honest, do you have problems with gas and bloating?","I've been vegan approaching 2 year now and honestly this has been a nightmare for me. I always have to fart when before going vegan I would go weeks without having to fart at all. I miss that so much.

The constant discomfort and bloating, waiting for the next fart and wondering how bad it will smell is really wearing down on me. I will never stop being vegan but if I was ever to present a counter argument this would be it. My quality of life is seriously tarnished by this. I always feel slight discomfort in my stomach and every time I eat I have to fart like crazy an hour later. It smells disgusting and makes me have stomach cramps. It makes me hating eating. I feel gross. My room smells bad, my chair smells bad...

Is this really what being vegan is like? I have started hoping that cultured meat becomes available on the next 10 years so that I can eat something like chicken breast again, not because the taste but because I want to feel good, because this bloating and gas is horrible. It's actually making me depressed."
vegan,Zoo pics make me sad,"You know those eye bleach or awww subreddits? Sometimes the photos are truly heartwarming. However, the photos of “cute animal does something cute in their enclosure/tank/cage” are heartbreaking. It’s so sad to see them imprisoned in such small spaces, on display to entertain people. They should be out in the wild with their families and social groups, enjoying their freedom, eating their natural diet, roaming freely. Please, let’s eliminate zoos, period."
vegan,Petition to gey Daiya to stop selling their original version,"Just ordered from an Indian pizza place. Their vegan cheese or choice (as every pizza place I have gone to) is Daiya's original formulation. I live in the Pacific Northwest. I haven't even seen this version for sell at the grocery store in over 2 years. I understand that some parts of the country still sell the original version and the new version under a ""cutting board"" collection banner while others of us are only able to buy the new formula, but it's about time Daiya fully switched over. 

The original version of mozzarella that is still getting sold to pizza places (are they not allowed to purchase the new version?) Has a consistency and taste that every person I know agrees is ""too much like semen.""

Just stop, Daiya, please. You guys are amazing. Just accept that the original version was bad and call it a day."
vegan,Annoying feelings,"has anyone ever started developing  some serious feelings for someone who isn't vegan? I know not every vegan cares if their partner is or isn't vegan but for me personally (being single) being with someone who has similar moral values is important to me.

There's actually a million and one reasons why a potential relationship between me and the person wont work out. Talk some sense into me because i go full lizard brain every time i think about it."
vegan,Looking for more prepared meals/combos of packaged and fresh ingredient recipes?,"Fairly new to veganism. I have a lot of more simple staple dinners but I’m just tired of my regular rotation (a lot of Mexican or Indian-inspired meals that are rice/bean centric). Last night I bought a few packages of Kite Hill tortellini because they were on sale and with it I sautéed zucchini, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, lemon zest and olive oil/parsley/red pepper flake. Delicious. I’ve also done Flatbread’s Vegan Harvest frozen pizza and added broccoli, garlic, scallions, and hot sauce quite a few times. Everyday Dal’s butternut squash and lentil packet is good; I try to jazz it up with fresh herbs and cauliflower. 

Things along those lines to save time while integrating fresh produce or legumes would be awesome. Lower sodium is a plus.

Cost isn’t really all that much of a concern. I’m just overwhelmed by the options and would like some product endorsements from the community.

Thanks!"
vegan,"Vegans, I’m curious: what is your gender?","I’ve always heard that veganism is “for women”, “feminine”, or “weak”, and there’s that whole “soyboy” thing that carnists throw around, too. I know that, statistically speaking, women do tend to gravitate toward veganism more than men, but this lifestyle is for *everyone*, so I’m genuinely curious what our gender demographic makeup looks like.

vegan,Costco Membership Worth It?,"As the title suggests, a Costco was just built in our area of Florida for the first time. I’ve never been to one myself but have been inside of a Sam’s Club before. I wasn’t impressed with Sams’ offerings for vegan eating, but with the rising costs of groceries I’m seriously considering a bulk store subscription.

Anyone out there have much luck shopping at Costco? Do you think a subscription is worth it or would I still need to go to other grocery stores to find some of the essentials?"
vegan,how would I go about becoming a vegan?,"So recently I was thinking about how the factory farming system in America is very cruel to animals. I don't know very much about it but I do understand innocent animals are essentially tortured and raised in disgusting condition solely so we can consume them. but I was wondering how would I go about becoming vegan? 
Where would I get my protein? 
Is it generally difficult finding restaurants or grocery stores that are compatible with veganism? 
Is it expensive? (I don't make very much money) 
How restrictive is your diet as a vegan? 
What do you substitute meat with in your meals? 

I'm genuinely considering cutting meat out of my diet but I have no idea how to go about it."
vegan,we are really living in a dystopia,"i dont know why i thought i could change peoples minds about going vegan, of course regular people dont care about the animals. they dont even care about other humans. people will happily spend hundreds of dollars on shein and not care in the slightest that their tags have “help” written all over them and even make jokes about it in their shein haul videos. im just honestly really disgusted and disheartened, people have no empathy and immediately stop caring ab an issue the second it inconveniences them. this is a truly dystopian society and i really feel like im living in a black mirror episode"
vegan,why,"i have wanted to do this for a while. i realized i learn the most when im shocked into it. it lights a fire. i could never stick to it until my kitty flew away to the other side. now i want to do this and do anything i can to help animals. especially kitties like my kitty. she is my motivating factor in not giving up because i feel i need to make a difference somehow. not just by going vegan but in many ways, but especially animals and especially kitties. i hope to kick out my selfishness and help whats left in any way i can. what goes around comes around. i want to make a difference. i want to make my kitty proud. i think the way humans function is destructive in more ways than i or anyone can comprehend. this is a small step into contributing, but i hope it makes a difference. we do more damage than we even realize, thinking it's doing good. i think a lot, i hope to never stop. i wanted to die for so long but i realized im not ready yet. i have something i need to do. i have a lot to learn. i am limited by my own perspective and all i can do is learn and hope. giving up would not do anything to fix things. i still wonder if there's a point but i can't stop moving."
vegan,Dominion Watch Buddy,"I want to watch Dominion, but going into it I'm aware of how incredibly difficult it to watch given that, well, it's a film about torture and abuse. Is there anyone who'd like to watch it with me? I was thinking of connecting on Zoom or something similar with someone and we can watch it together so that it's easier to watch, but we can also chat with the Reddit chat feature or something of the like if you're not comfortable with using Zoom with a stranger. 

Thank you so much if anyone is comfortable with watching it with me! The more people who want to do this with me, the better. It'd be awesome if we could even create a group of people to watch it with."
vegan,better idea than using dog meat as comparison,"While I think pointing out that eating dogs is no worse than eating the regularly consumed animals is a good way to point out moral inconsistency among omnis, I think a better way would be to point out horses and rabbits because the omni community has less of a consensus about these types of animals than they do about dogs; probably because rabbits and horses, while they are pets, are also herbivores and are consumed for food much more commonly than dogs in the western world."
vegan,A scenario I don't think most vegans have considered given the current supreme court of the US,"Given the decline of women's rights and an incoming theocracy in the US there are many things to be concerned about, but there is one scenario that occured to me when contemplating the end conclusion of abortion rights and what it might mean for vegans.

The right's arguement is that a group of cells is the same as a fully grown human being. Thus they view a collection of cells as having the same human rights as a fully grown human.

There are very dark implications to this view but I pose the following scenario. If a group of cells is a fully grown human being then lawsuits can be made on its behalf.

Suppose a pregnant woman's mother-in-law doesn't like that she is on a vegan diet while pregnant. Such mother-in-law could then make a lawsuit against the mother on the fetus's behalf that the mother should have to consume animal products. There is ample scientific evidence that this claim is absurd, but do you really think a conservative GOP judge is really going to take that into account? 

Anyway, the decline of women's rights in the US spells a dark future for all of us."
vegan,Vegan X Movie lover community?,"Anyone know of a Reddit page of vegans that are also movie fans? Or would there be interest for one? It's always nice to talk to fellow vegans with similar interests and I know there's gotta be quite a few other nerds out there that love some good cinema (e.g. Sharkboy and Lavagirl, Morbius, Fred: The Movie etc.) 

If this post does have enough interaction, I could maybe take the time to throw a community together."
vegan,I was a meat eater and smoker for most of my life. Im done with both.,"Ethics aside, what got me to be vegan was seeing pictures of people pooping out worms after eating papaya seeds and taking a tincture called paraguard, a concoction of various detoxing herbs. 

I tried both, had good poops and soon after I cut coffee, meat and dairy from my diet. I now drink herbal tea and eat sourdough bread, hummus, fruit and almonds and feel great. I have more energy and feel satiated all day. 

I also cut out toxic people from my life. Several long term acquaintances. Soon after, I quit smoking. By changing my diet and dropping toxic acquaintances, I feel like a new person. I’m about a month into this new regime and feel like it’ll stick. 

I’ll never eat meat again because eating meat creates a home for parasites and worms in our body. So when we crave meat or sugar, it’s not us that craves it but the worms dwelling in the rotting meat in our gut. That thought alone is what got me to turn vegan. 

I think it’s a hard sell to get people to change their diet because meat tastes so darn good. Maybe talking up gut worms may be another approach. It worked for me. Okay. That’s all thanks for reading."
vegan,I don't like when many people makes fun of vegans !,"I recently saw some post on this sub or on some other platforms that are targeted against vegans, I don't really understand why would you do so and they don't have factual data to support them....just some rubbish, but I am proud of those people who give them counter arguments on basis of facts.
For me Veganism is not only a way of life, it is the future!
Trying to become vegan, I haven't eaten meat for 1 year now. It was tough but I did it, now moving to next step😎"
vegan,how to respectfully decline non vegan food at family gatherings?,"I was a vegetarian for ten years, and then for about a month recently I started eating meat again but felt intensely guilty and decided it was still against my morals to eat meat, and I also decided I'm going to give up meat and dairy altogether and go vegan. I love it, I feel great, it's been amazing for my mind and body. 

Only problem is my extended family got used to making vegetarian dishes for me, but cheese and meat is kind of the main things they eat, so all the vegetarian dishes were always cheese heavy. I want to just bring my own food to family events because I don't want to put pressure on them to make me vegan food, but it's seen as disrespectful to not eat the food the family cooks, and I want to avoid getting made fun of because the men always make jokes about my diet and say ""if you had this sub from (x restaurant) you'd never go back to being vegan/vegetarian"". I'm kind of anxious about how to go about this, as there's going to be a family reunion at the end of the month and food is a big part of my family's traditions. 

Any advice?

Tldr; how not to offend family by not eating their non-vegan food?"
vegan,Why I do not like most vegans,"Now I'm okay if you are vegan and okay with somebody eating meat, but what I'm not okay with is you trying to tell me what I can and can't eat. So these are some reasons why I don't like most vegans. 

1. They think that they are better than everyone else. They really aren't. They are just as equal as everybody else. They might state that it is a fact that they are better than everybody else, but it is really just an opinion. 
2. They are kind of annoying. They constantly say ""Be vegan"" over and over again. As if that's going to make us go vegan. Saying ""Be vegan"" over and over again is not going to convince us to go vegan, it's actually driving us further from being vegan, and honestly, it is pretty annoying. 
3. They are usually hypocritical. They say that us omnivores provide our facts by just looking at google but that is what the vegans do too. 
4. They are pretty toxic. Calling us ""animal abusers"" is the definition of toxic. 
5. They think that veganism is quickly rising. Keep in mind, veganism makes up less than 1% of the world's population."
vegan,Any vegan cooking competitions?,Hello! Been vegan 3 years and I used to love watching cooking competition shows but more and more I can't enjoy watching them.

vegan,The issue of self-sufficient food production,"A couple times recently, I’ve encountered a fringy argument against veganism that I’m not sure how to counter effectively. I’m hoping we can put our heads together and brainstorm a good response.

The argument is that some people want to be self-sufficient in producing their own food because they don’t want to rely on globalized food production and its potential for collapse. I can empathize with this argument, because I’m also scared of supply chain issues due to climate breakdown, wars, pandemics, and other unrest. To that end, I actually think some level of prepping is practical and smart, but rice and beans aren’t a long-term solution if shit really hits the fan, because eventually they’ll run out, and most people don’t live in climates where they can sustain themselves long-term on home-grown plant-based foods alone. It’s also not like these people can be plant-based now and just get animals if an emergency happens—they have to have animals now to be prepared for a possible emergency.

I personally don’t think I’d kill an animal even in a life-or-death situation, but I’ve also never been in that situation, and as much as I’m a diehard liberationist, that’s not a decision I feel comfortable making for someone else because I know some people do rely on animal products for survival. In a survival situation, I could maybe see eating eggs (or at least feeding them to my dog because it would be hard to watch her starve to death).

The one place the logic falls apart is that in a collapse situation, these people likely wouldn’t be able to buy feed for their animals either, and if they’re growing their own animal feed, it would be more efficient to consume that feed themselves. But I think chickens can probably sustain themselves on weeds/bugs and ruminants would maybe still have grass and other plants that are inedible to people, so picking at that flaw might not be effective.

Is this an argument you’ve heard before? Does anyone here have a clever response?"
vegan,Customers are grossed out,"… finding feathers on their eggs.
I work at a grocery store, not going to say which one. Anyways, whenever I’m on register to ring up customers I double check that the eggs they’re purchasing are not broken. 
Last week, there seem to have a particular batch of eggs shipped with feathers on the eggs. Obviously several customers did not check the eggs themselves based on their reactions to seeing feathers in the cartons. Their reactions were comical as they seemed shocked the eggs were not “throughly cleaned” and it seemed “unsanitary” for them to be packaged.

Did a dozen of these people forget where eggs come from? Do they not know what eggs are? 

I was stunned and entertained by it all. Just wanted to share."
vegan,"I've created a Vegan Recipe Book, completely FREE for everyone!","Hey r/vegan, I recently posted in r/veganuk about some meals I made in my downtime and they were generally well-liked. I decided to put a few of them together along with their recipes in a (hopefully) easy to follow recipe book and share with everyone!

**Quick things about me, if you'd like to know!**

* I'm a (Qualified) Nutritionist and Personal Trainer in the UK.
* I have a Masters in Nutrition and Exercise.
* I'm also PhD Student in Nutrition, my PhD title/thesis/area of expertise is in plant-based Nutrition.

**About the recipe book:**

* I originally had no intention of sharing the meals at all (I sent a few to friends, of course!); I was just enjoying myself experimenting and mixing/matching recipes I found from here and there. The main goal(s) being to either make a Vegan version, or to make a common meal a little more interesting - alongside varying my own diet.
* Due to this, I never kept the recipes! So I've had to redo them as best as I could. This will be Volume 1, tentatively - hopefully I have the time to make Vol 2!

Any questions at all, ask away! :)

vegan,[Serious] What is your view on anti-venom/venin production?,"So from my understanding you do not wish to exploit animals by consuming things they produce, or using things that contain animal products. This mostly includes dairy but I'm wondering what your view is on anti-venom and its production. 

Anti-venom is made using snake and insect venom which is then injected into a large farm animal at a safe amount so that the animal can build up antibodies to the venom in its blood. Then a non-lethal (because it's mostly horses and most people aren't going to want you to bleed their horse to death) amount of blood is taken from the animal and spun down to create a drug that acts kind of like a vaccine. 

Given that this process uses animals and their secretions, I'm wondering what you actually think of it and how it fits or does not fit into your philosophy.

It uses animals, it also saves lives."
vegan,How long have you been vegan and what made you decide to be vegan?,"I've been vegan for over 7 years now. For me, my mom was a big influence on me as she was vegan before me. I also saw videos of how animals were treated and such. Then one day I was like, yeah I'm not eating meat and dairy anymore and here we are 7 years later!

Follow up question - what's your favorite vegan meal to eat?"
vegan,Going 100% vegan overnight isn’t easy for everyone and acting like it is is part of the problem.,"I see this issue on almost every post here. There’s always someone saying “I went vegan overnight, it’s not hard, they’re just lazy and hate animals blah blah”.

I took a year to finally go vegan. Am I proud of it? No, obviously not. If I could do it over again, I’d do it in an instant, but that’s just not how it played out for me.

I’m a dietetics student and was learning about plant-based diets. I began to learn about the miraculous reversals in chronic disease (from WFPB in particular) and promises of healthy weight loss, and I was learning that nutritional deficiencies *really* aren’t that much of an issue for most people on plant-based diets. I was amazed.

However, I had admittedly been intentionally turning a blind eye to animal agriculture because *I was scared*. I was in a bad place mentally, suicidal more often than not, and seeing the brutal, pure evil that goes on behind closed doors would’ve likely cut that last bit of hope from my life. I know that’s headass, since the animals go through way worse than mental illness, but again, that’s just what happened for me. But after I started eating more plant based and making a slow transition for my health (and making medication changes with a psychiatrist), I began feeling better mentally. One day, I sat down to watch what I thought was just going to be another WFPB health documentary.

That documentary was H.O.P.E - What You Eat Matters. It started out nutrition-oriented, but before I knew it, I was watching the reality of the treatment of animals unfold in front of me. After a year of studying a “vegan diet”, there was suddenly something in front of me that was bigger than books and articles. But by that point, instead of wanting to give up on my life, I was in the mental place to feel determined to make a difference. That day was the day I went vegan. There’s a lot more to my story, but this is the main bit.

There’s a variety of reasons people transition into veganism instead of flipping like a light switch. There’s strong cognitive dissonance for some, huge sociocultural factors, fear of the unknown, fear of giving up one’s favorite comfort foods (not always out of selfishness, there’s a big emotional dependency of some foods for people; I struggle with binge eating disorder and breaking through an already-strong, uncontrollable impulse to make a change was NOT easy for me), all sorts of things. 

Again, they’re not excuses, nothing justifies supporting such a terrible industry with your dollars and fork, but they are reasons people have trouble. 

I came on this sub once before I was vegan and just got intimidated by the gatekeeping and extremist attitudes around here, and it immediately drove me away from seeking the help and advice I was needing on making the change. I eventually went to r/AskVegans and asked all of the burning questions I had (which Google couldn’t necessarily answer because of all the conflicting info out there). I got a ton of useful advice and I felt much more comfortable with overhauling my entire diet and lifestyle. Someone even sent me a DM with tons of resources and links. I knew my questions were probably stupid to them, but they answered anyway without passing judgement (to my face, at least).

The main issue with transitioning is getting complacent and feeling like you’re doing “enough” and just stopping at Meatless Mondays or some shit. But some vegetarians genuinely want to be vegan, and we should be helping them instead judging them. We need to allow them to ask questions that may seem stupid or heartless to us. We don’t need to “congratulate” or “celebrate” them for eating less animal products, we just shouldn’t be shitting on them so much.

You can’t force or belittle someone into going vegan on YOUR time. You can and shoukd plant the seeds, you can and should water them, but you can’t make someone grow. Discouraging and insulting people isn’t an effective way to get them to listen to you. 

What matters at the very end of it all is that they eventually DO cut out all animal products and become one less consumer supporting the animal agriculture industry. I could’ve just remained blissfully ignorant and fought to justify shit to myself, but I’m here *now*, and that’s what’s important.

I’ll probably end up deleting this post, I just wanted to vent my frustrations on this."
vegan,I need some help,"My wife (32f) came to me about 5 years ago and said she wanted to be Vegan. As someone who never was a 'foodie' and obviously wanting to please my wife said 'yes'. It quickly turned into something I was passionate about and cared immensely for. We both truly loved being Vegan. We have a son (7m) and a daughter (15f) who have been Vegan with us for 5 years. We have always told them in this house we eat Vegan but when you are with your friends you can eat whatever you want as it's your choice.

Flash forward to 2022, My wife and I started to volunteer at a Vegan Animal Sanctuary near us. We have loved it. We have gotten to interact with pigs, goats, bunnies, horses, cows, ducks, turkeys, etc etc. It has been awesome.

Now I am not going to lie and say being Vegan has been easy. My in-laws are very much carnivores but have gotten a whole lot better at understanding this ""vegan thing"" isn't going to go away and basically learn to live with it lol. But it weighs heavily on my wife as going out to dinner with her parents is always an ordeal. Or travelling is harder then it would be for a non-vegan. It never really bothered me because this is what we signed up for when we went vegan. And to be honest the amount of Vegan options has greatly increased in the last 5 years alone.

Now to where I need help...

My wife came to me 2 days ago and long story short told me for her mental health she is contemplating not having the 'vegan' title anymore and being more open to eating other things (animal byproducts) when we go out to dinner with people. The stress of finding a place all the 'foodies' like that offer vegan options is not great added to her anxiety and stress already. I was shook but didn't want to come off as an asshole as I wanted to know why she was feeling this way. I was trying to be supportive and offer by sides to the situation so that she could decided if it was truly something she wanted.

Backstory on me. I am lactose-intolerant times 100. I never knew it until we went Vegan and I stopped literally pooping my pants and having bad acne, bad gas, everything. It truly was night and day and when I realized what a normal bowel system was like I told her I would never eat dairy again. To add to that I can never eat meat again. Knowing what I know now I just can't consume either. 

With that being said though I knew where I stood and I didn't want to come off stand-ofish and rude so I tried to be understanding. Well, we talked to my daughter 2 nights ago and she basically told us she was bullied in middle school for being a Vegan and it sucked and she hated it but she didn't really tell us because she knew it would cause a rift of 'what we believed in' and her. She told my wife that she would also like to not be strictly vegan so that they have more freedom when out of the house.

I heard those words and my emotions where all over the place. I wanted to cry, I wanted to throw up, I wasn't sure what I was feeling. But again I tried to be supportive to the situation and the stress/anxiety they felt about it. (My son just wants to eat the junk food at birthday parties and honestly I can't blame him).

So fast forward to yesterday. My wife and daughter wanted to try something non-vegan. So we went to Rite-Aid and the kids picked out some candies (like gummy bears, chocolate bar, etc) and my wife wanted some Chai latte thing from Dunkin Donuts as it was easier to consume first. Then late lunch comes around and again they wanted to try something ""easy"" so they started talking about McDonald's French fries. I agreed and went to get them and they also then wanted Chicken Nuggets with Honey because it was something they used to love before being vegan. Again I got the food for them. Took it back home and they ate it. Obviously it felt weird to them but said it was good.

Then dinner rolls around. I walk into the living room and and my wife and daughter are on the couch and I know they were talking about something. At this point in time they know they I am still unsure of what I want to eat in the future but I am holding on to being Vegan for now. I am okay not calling myself Vegan and hoping to remove the judgement that comes along with it but still eat only Vegan food and also Vegan lifestyle. My wife asks me if it is okay if they order pizza for dinner. Again, I said it was okay and it doesn't bother me and basically they can eat whatever they want because it's their choice. They ordered pizza and got it delivered... The pizza was MASSIVE lol. To put in perspective I have made pizza at home for the past 5 years. We all love and they all say how much they love the crust and flavor and crispyness but it's a normal thick crust and not thin crust. I put the non-vegan pizza on the table and open the box and I can immediately smell the cheese and grease. It hit me like a ton of bricks and I wanted to vomit so bad. My wife and daughter both get a slice (and my son but he was off in another room). We all sit down on the couch to watch a show. I heat up my noodles and Impossible Sausage and ate that.   
This is where it started to sting. My wife ate some and was blown away by how it tasted and how it reminded her of pizza from before. My daughter scarfed it down lol and they kept laughing and giggling and my daughter was trying to hide her face from me. After a while they started to question me because I seemed off and wanted to know what was going on because I said I was fine by my body language was showing I wasn't. I tried to de-escalte and reassure them that I was fine and they can eat what they want and there is no judgement from me. The whole time I could smell the cheese and my stomach was in knots.

The conversation got to a point where I was losing it and told my wife if I ate a bite of the pizza would it stop the conversation and prove to her that I am not judging her and that I don't think I am better then them. So I did. I ate a little bite and swallowed it. My gag reflex was unlike anything I have ever had before. I felt maybe the lowest I have felt. Like I know what went into that pepperoni pizza... I can't not unsee what went into making cheese and meat.

So now we are at today and I am at a lost for feelings or words. I am always at the verge of just crying and I think that is because my body just doesn't know how to feel about these feelings. I am a 33(m) and never really expressed emotions ever. I feel betrayed is the best way I can describe it.

&amp;#x200B;

During our Vegan 5 years my wife has always said that the worst part about the animal agriculture and all non-vegan things is the raping of cows to impregnate them and then taking their children from them after birth and taking the 'breastmilk' because she was a mom of 2 who breastfeed her children. Honestly it was something that was so attractive about her that she had those feelings and expressed it clearly. But that is why all of this feels like a betrayal. She knows something is off with me now. I am trying so hard to hide it to not start a huge ordeal. My wife and kids are not bad people or even mean people but it just feels like total hypocrisy. And I know I am no angel either so I feel like I don't have the ability to judge them because of that.

&amp;#x200B;

I just need insight from other Vegans as to what to do, what to say, what to feel. I am so lost. Thankfully I have work to keep my mind off things but if this is what normal life is going to be like then I don't know if I can handle it.

&amp;#x200B;

More background: we bought this house 2 years ago (right at the start of COVID). It was a total gut job and everything down to studs. My wife and I talked about how cool it would be that the kitchen would be 100% new and clean and never have been used on Animal products. It was something I took pride in when fixing up the house and the kitchen specifically. Like I did this, I made this area that a dead animal has never touched or no animal suffering was caused from this kitchen. I am still renovating the house (as I am doing it myself) and I have lost all will to keep going because I feel like it's pointless now.

&amp;#x200B;

Guys I don't know, I am just lost and I am hoping random internet strangers could shed some light on this for me. Love you all, thanks in advance."
vegan,Moral Dilemma,"I work as an independent Graphic Designer/ Artist where I design logos for artists and small companies. I regularly receive offers from start-up companies that sell meat and leather jackets. I'm conflicted if its morally right to help advertise a company that goes against my belief. I suppose that the company would go to a different designer and I really just did was lose a two-week salary.

Advice?"
vegan,Breakfast ideas with protein?,"Hi all, I have followed a mostly plant-based diet for a while, save for eggs and salmon. However, I have decided to cut out eggs and salmon as well now to be fully vegan. For the past few months, I would say 28 or 29 days a month I would have three eggs and overnight oats for breakfast. I'm wondering if anyone has recommendations for vegan breakfasts that would have around 15+ grams of protein."
vegan,Skin Tags on face from plant-based meat products?,"Hi everyone! I've been vegan for 1.5 years and I've just come to realise that whenever I eat meat alternatives with soya isolates, I tend to get dark spots and even skin tags forming on my face. I'm not sure if it's Tofu, as Tempeh has never caused issues, but I may cut out Tofu for when I cook food at home too. 

Has anyone else developed any form of skin tags due to a plant-based diet? Any specific thing that helped stopped it for you, diet or cosmetic cream-wise? This would be very appreciated please. TIA!"
vegan,"Please don’t kill me for saying this, I’m just asking; Is eating meat part of the natural life cycle?","Yes. I know we have mass produced food and massive farms that would eliminate the need to eat meat. 

However, isn’t the mass production a problem itself? If we eliminate the big corporations and made things more local and became more sustainable, would eating meat/using animal parts to survive be inevitable? Of course not immediately, but over time wouldn’t society have to resort back to hunting? 

I’m not saying right now we *have* to consume meat, but in a world where everything is flowing naturally, would that be a part of it?"
vegan,Struggling to get enough protein after starting weight lifting,"Hi everyone, 

I just recently started weight lifting and was told to increase my protein intake. I never measured my intake until now and I find myself struggling a lot to get this much protein without exceeding my recommended calorie intake and starting to gain weight. 

It just seems excessively much without drinking some sort of protein shakes. I can’t eat tofu every single day and only get this far with beans and legumes. 

The numbers say I should get around 120g of protein a day while eating between 1500-1800 calories a day.  That is not that much food and doesn’t seem feasible except if I eat a whole can of beans at night to meet the goal. Websites suggest almonds or peanut butter which are really high in Calories and the few grams in Brokkoli or other foods are a drop on a hot stone at this point. Does everyone else use protein supplements? How do you do it?"
vegan,Music Survey for University," 

Hello guys,

I'm a master's student at the University of Padova, Italy and I am currently working on my master's thesis on the topic of **Spotify and Music Personality**. I want to collect data on usage behavior and if/how people listen different kinds of music on Spotify

It would be much appreciated if some of you guys could participate in this since I need as many participants as possible. It should take no more than 3-4 mins and is mostly just checking little boxes, no typing required.

The link for this survey is: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSflYtqaz3eXnOGPY4nKlggusXcQ2mxfy6jptmFuQwQMHtmbcw/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSflYtqaz3eXnOGPY4nKlggusXcQ2mxfy6jptmFuQwQMHtmbcw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

vegan,I thought almond milk has added calcium…?,"I ordered 6 litres of unsweetened almond milk to replace my cows milk assuming (stupid me) that they’d be fortified with calcium, but when they got here I saw on the packaging that they literally have no calcium whatsoever…? On the packaging it says “SOURCE OF CALCIUM” and hence my assumption but nope.

Now I’m stuck with 6 boxes of water that have 2% almond in them and nothing else lol. So does it truly not contain calcium or is it just… hidden from the ingredients list or something? Thought almond milk is supposed to be fortified?

vegan,Do you honey... Do you eat avocados?,"I’m in the process of transitioning to a vegan lifestyle and would like to know if avocados are vegan?

This is on the basis that they are a fruit that uses bees for pollination, where a queen bee and her worker bees are transported around fruit farms and surely this is exploitation.

**Activism**

I highly recommend and encourage those who have not engaged in any form of activism yet to do so, because the only reason the vegan movement has made so much progress so far is due to people actively trying to make a positive change in the world.

vegan,Disappointed. Need to rant,"Using alt account.

So recently, a family member of mine called me on the phone. She told me her daughter wanted to speak to be urgently. She passes the phone, and her 8 year old daughter tells me: ""I'm not eating meat anymore I want to be vegan becauseI care about animals.""

I'm ecstatic. Forcing my beliefs on people finally worked!! (jokes... I need to laugh)

I'm happy because she apparently came to this conclusion on her own after learning about farms at school.

My relative asks me for simple, quick recipes that won't take more time than her regular recipes and don't cost more.

I send a metric ton of resources. Meals that can be prepared in one pot with simple ingredients, that take 10 minutes, that cost $1 per serving, websites, i ship a book. I'm happy and excited.

I don't hear back.

I call my relative a week or two later to inquire how the veganism is going. She says: ""it's not. \[My daughter\] loves meat too much. We had steak that same day we called you and she asked for more with 'extra meat juice.'"" So I ask if there was a meat-free alternative offered. She says ""No, we only made the steak.""

Like... Seriously? What do you expect from an 8 year old who can't cook and eats whatever her parents give her.

I was so annoyed. I put a lot of effort into helping, finding cheap and fast recipes, and she goes and prepares a $50 slab of meat. Apparently $12+/serving is less expensive than $1/serving. Plus, what of your daughter's wishes? She expressly said she didn't want to eat animals. She told me she eats cereal with water and cocoa powder because she refused to drink milk (and you won't buy plant milk), and you go and give her no vegan options?

Ugh...

vegan,I'm nervous a bad business-to-business transaction will affect my vegan restaurant,"I hired a plumber who did a truly terrible job considering how expensive they were.  They made a mistake causing damage, fixed the mistake, but didn't repair the damage.  I wrote a bad review on my personal Google account.  The owner responded brashly, doxxing my business.  We were in contact and he implicitly threatened to use his reputation to harm the reputation of my new business.    
As a vegan, would bad initial reviews prevent you from trying a place?  I'm worried he'll bombard my page with 1-star reviews once I'm open (July 2nd)."
vegan,I love my mom - but I am over the dead fish photos…,"My mom and her husband are on this grand RV trip through New England. (Let’s ignore the fact that their monstrosity of an RV burns an irresponsible amount of fuel.) They have been fishing and catching lobster, and then she turns around and sends me pictures of her with the lobster caught after it’s cooked.

I love her. She is a great mom. But she knows I don’t eat meat and haven’t in years. I don’t understand why she thinks I want to hear about the amazing swordfish she caught, and how fresh it is.

Sorry - just needed somewhere to vent."
vegan,Legitimate animal rescue?,"A friend of mine was approached by [this rescue](https://instagram.com/animalloverescue?igshid=NmZiMzY2Mjc=) in Costa Rica, about a social media collab where they promised some things in return which seems too good to be true. So my friend wants to make sure they’re not getting scammed. 

Do you guys know about Animal Love Rescue Centre? Have you had any interactions with them that make you feel like they’re trustworthy?"
vegan,Lost my appetite,"Hey everyone 🙂 I’ve started my vegan journey end of march of this year. I’ve lost 15 pounds so far, no complaint there, but I’ve seem to have completely lost my appetite to literally everything. No matter how hard I try I can’t physically force myself to eat anymore it makes me feel so sick. I’ve been living off of different nuts and coffee lol. I know this isn’t healthy and I feel so weak and tired all the time but I don’t know what to do and was wondering if anyones experienced this before? After watching so many documentaries and doing my own research (google searches lol) everything grosses me out. Help!"

vegan,"You're throwing a wedding. The food must be 100% vegan and NOT from a place that serves meat. Very high price limit, lower 48 US. Where do you go?","My fiancee and I started to look over wedding venues and it's a bit ridiculous how there are no purely vegan places to go. We're so done with high class restaurants that act like we're second class citizens... ""I *guess* we can accommodate"" etc. Or almost worse, the ones that say they're fine with making vegan stuff but you always get the same nonsense from lazy chefs, stuffed peppers or stuffed mushrooms (because this is what they have on hand and it looks great but it's freakin lazy and boring). We sat down and thought about it and we're like, no one else has to compromise on our ONE DAY, why the hell should we?

I'm taking the stress off her shoulders. Got some places I could start with?"
vegan,Outreach to Christian Scientists re: Veganism,"There is a ""Christian Science Reading Room"" on my block. I pass by it every day and I keep thinking about it. Is it a cult? *Seems kinda culty*. Are there good people there? 

Do you think it would be a worthwhile endeavor to leave some Christian-Vegan pamphlets and literature? In addition of the other vegan outreach I do, should I come and speak to people there about why Veganism is important, with regards to Christian teachings and commandments, and also for their physical health?

Or are they brick walls that will hound me down and harass me like JWs and Scientologists?

FWIW, I grew up Christian, and I am no longer Christian but Athiest-Buddhist. I wonder if these people would be receptive to this information within the framework of their own religious beliefs and if there is a way I can speak to them persuasively as an 'outsider', or if I should give the idea up and move on."
vegan,My favorite way to live on people is to accommodate their dietary needs,"I first learned about veganism when someone I knew was eating Christmas dinner at our house. Their parents were bringing food and I was cooking too. Because they were vegan, I made everything I made vegan. Nothing their parents brought was vegan. They had actually brought a can of garbanzo beans to make falafel. When they saw the cake, stuffing, main dish and vegan egg nog that I made, they cried. I never say food is love, because I feel that it promotes an unhealthy relationship with food, but inclusiveness is love. 

I’m not full on vegan yet, but I am vegetarian now and don’t eat dairy (so just eggs) and I’m keto. Thanks to that experience."
vegan,Sometimes I wish it was possible to go back to being stupid and terrible.,"I'm too emotional. Everytime I scroll through reddit I just hate everyone, I know a lot of you probably saw that post about the processed bison.. scrolling through the comments of that made my stumach turn, and I'm just anxious about so much so stuff like that on top of it really doesn't help. This guy I talk to is my friend but I can't stop thinking about one little comment he made about how he's gonna keep enjoying meat after he had asked me a question about why I'm vegan. It doesn't help that he's a farmer, not factory farming but still gross. I don't want to like him less because of that but I do, and I hate that. I hate everyone I know, and everytime I'm reminded of the fact that they live the way they do bothers me way too much."
vegan,Finally Vegan,"7 years ago when I was in middle school I decided to start writing a story about a girl who had to learn everything from scratch again, and that led me to a complex question- how do you convince someone to eat meat? It is already inherently cruel and one of the characters was already vegetarian. I thought about justifying it as natural, but I knew that wasn't true. It couldn't be true because I had vegan friends. Faced with such a hard question that shook the foundations of my own beliefs- I chose to ignore it.  


And I did that a lot. I accepted what my parents always told me, and I also grew into a pretty big conservative for a bit because all I did was take things at face value. When I finally started re-evaluating my life I realized that I was a cruel person, so I instead swung rather left wing. But I didn't question my diet at all. As my father was a pretty big Joe Rogan and Elon Musk head, he was super into the whole carnivorous thing and would tell me all about it. However, by pure chance, I came across a video by Hunter Avallone.  


Hunter was someone that used to be a conservative back in the day and I used to watch him a lot. He recently became more left leaning though after also examining his own beliefs, and I was catching up with him after going through a similar experience. Then I saw something that surprised me, he went vegan. I always thought of him as a pretty smart guy and so I wanted to know why and watched one of his videos.  


After that I knew I couldn't eat meat anymore.  


I began doing more research on my own to see if it was healthy- and lo and behold it was all this time. I saw documentary after documentary, asked advice, looked at statistics and in my heart of hearts I knew that I had to change. Meat became disgusting. But for two months I had to continue. I was still living with my dad and I knew he'd become enraged with me if I challenged him and changed my diet. But for the summer I moved out for college and I finally had freedom.   


The last thing my father told me was to make sure I ate right and all I can say is. Yes. Yes I will."
vegan,Being the only vegan at a dinner party actually slaps,"I'm going to a joint birthday party for my grandparents this weekend and they're all having Five Guys. I will probably eat a few handfuls of their delicious fries, but it means I don't *HAVE* to order a burger. I can literally order anything I want.

I feel that my power is unlimited. They're all stuck eating the same thing they eat at every party (my family ALWAYS gets Five Guys) and I have a choice of any cuisine I want.

Being vegan's great."
vegan,a reminder for everyone,"on my way to a relative's for dinner (i'm bringing my own food, of course) so these are as much self-affirmations as reminders for u guys:

- every day u wake up and choose compassion u are a hero to animals

vegan,affordable vegan chocolate,"hi! i’m 16 and i’ve been vegetarian since i was 7. over the years i’ve been considering veganism and recently realized that i actually do only eat a vegan diet, except for one thing: chocolate. i eat a kind bar every morning and a handful of chocolate chips for dessert. i love the purdys chocolate, but it’s a bit pricy.

anyone know any good 200cal granola bar alternatives to a kind bar that are vegan? vegan chocolate chips? brand recs pls! i would really like to go ‘fully’ vegan."
vegan,What should I say to the idea that factory farming footage is propaganda?,"My partner's cousins were visiting and they asked me why I am vegan. I said I saw some factory farming footage and that it ""wasn't very nice"". My partner then chimed in and said it was propaganda. I didn't even realize my partner thought that way and wasn't prepared to give a response to that and so I ended up adding in ""and it's good for the environment"" which none of them disputed.

I'm honestly pretty upset with my partner. I didn't go into graphic detail; I just said factory farming isn't a kind practice, which it very much isn't.

Any idea how I can prove to my partner that the factory footage I saw isn't just propaganda and is indeed the norm?

They're very skeptical in general and won't believe something unless they find studies or an authoritative source that supports the claim."
vegan,Complete vegan nutrition infographic?,"Hi everyone. New vegan here. I stopped consuming animals 3 weeks ago, but I've been transitioning for about 6 months, and learning a ton along the way.

My question for you all: do you know of a complete nutrition infographic that includes everything vegans should pay attention to in their diet? I found \[this one\]([https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/vegan\_2D00\_health\_2D00\_infographic.jpg](https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/vegan_2D00_health_2D00_infographic.jpg)) from PETA that seems pretty good, but it doesn't mention B12, which seems rather important to mention to new vegans. I've seen a bunch of others for specific aspects (like \[this one\]([https://i.redd.it/ylz3ut2nrh541.jpg](https://i.redd.it/ylz3ut2nrh541.jpg)) for protein or \[this one\]([https://i.redd.it/knngb6erlk641.png](https://i.redd.it/knngb6erlk641.png)) for calcium) but I'd like one that includes everything.

vegan,HAS ANYONE FOUND AN ACTUAL GOOD RECIPE FOR HEMP SEED RANCH DRESSINGS/DIPS?,"I'm wondering if any of you have found a good recipe that you like for hemp seed ranch dressing or dip ? I like the idea of using hemp seeds because of their nutritional value, but I've tried several dressing/dip recipes, mainly for ""Ranch"" dressing or dip, on multiple recipe sites, and NONE of them taste  like ranch. They all taste like onion/garlic dressing/dip . It's not that i don't like onion/garlic, i do like it, and i know that ranch has those ingredients, but i was mainly looking for a ranch substitute that is ""healthy-ish"", and all these recipes have too much herbs and spices and do NOT taste anything like ranch. I have even tried cutting the spices in half, and it's still too much, and end up tasting so strongly that i end up with almost bitter, metallic taste in my mouth. Also, i think most of these recipe websites are fake bullshit sites run by huge media conglomerates just to push ads down our throats, and that the ""recipes"" are often questionable because this is not the first time i've run into bad recipe problems online. I'm no chef , but i'm not an idiot and i can measure and follow instructions."
vegan,Movie recommendations to inspire someone to go vegan &amp; other tips,"Hi, I'm vegan, and my boyfriend is now a pescetarian (he was eating meat when we met)

I used to be okay with people eating animal products around me, or I thought I was. I think I was just trying to avoid any conflict. However, after making a vegan friend, who always demands it from people who are close to her to at least try vegan options when around her, I realized that maybe it's okay to ask that of people. After all, if they claim to love you, wouldn't they want to respect your values and not make you sad every time you eat together.  
So I told my boyfriend that I can't be with someone if they're not vegan or aren't planning to do that switch, so we agreed he would switch gradually.

Now he is a pescetarian and we have ""vegan Saturdays"", meaning every Saturday he eats only vegan foods regardless if I'm around or not. I also teach him recipes and showed him several groups and constantly tell him about the horrors going on at farms and slaughterhouses, but I feel like the facts just aren't sinking in. 

I thought we could watch a movie that besides being a strong visual would be good research with verified facts. What movies do you recommend? I only watched Cowspiracy long ago.

What other tips do you have?"

vegan,Meat substitutes covered in blood,"I recently found another grocery store, much closer to home, carries the meat substitutes I like. Unfortunately this grocery store likes to keep the meat substitutes with their animal meat counterparts... getting blood juices all over the packaging of the meat substitutes. I mean... c'mon.

vegan,Overheard a little girl telling her dad how excited she was to try the vegan mac and cheese.,"I know it’s a small thing, but it makes me so happy to hear children excited about animals/veganism. 

I’m at the airport and this little girl and her dad walked by, the girl couldn’t have been older than 7/8. I only caught a little bit of the convo but she was telling her dad how excited she was that there was a vegan mac and cheese option wherever they were going. 

It seems like each generation gets better and better about animal activism. I know it’s such a little thing, but hearing someone so young excited about something being vegan was really awesome. Good luck on your vegan journey little girl!"

vegan,Will the climate crisis lead to an early vegan societal shift?,"Hi everyone, I've been vegan for six years now and it's the best decision I ever made. I want to ask you all a question about animal agriculture, climate change and persuasion. 

I am disgusted by the level of cruelty and the shocking levels of violence that go on behind slaughterhouse doors. Not to mention the amount of greenhouse gases factory farming produces- more than the transportation sector. Every day, I grow more angry about factory farming and more hopelessly dejected in the face of the climate crisis we are inevitably facing by this point. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my view, the best move forward for morality's sake and for climate change mitigation is to end factory farming.  End the abhorrent cruelties and denial to rights of life while, at the same time, seriously reducing greenhouse gas emissions, land usage, water usage and deforestation. It would obviously be a game changer in the movement to curb climate change if we were able to do this- the effects would could save thousands if not millions of human lives that would be lost due to the effects of climate change, not to mention the literal billions of animal lives spared from horrific fates. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is- how? How do we get there? Do you believe there is any hope for this goal of ending factory farming sooner rather than later for the sake of mitigation of climate change and environmental destruction? This seems to be the only way to frame it to people as framing it as a morality issue / animal rights issue often gets you nowhere (with some people- I know there are  exceptions to this rule). But when people are scared for their lives and their personal livelihood, as the pressures of climate change increase, would they then go vegan on a mass scale? Animal rights  and philosophical appeals seem to change individual behavior, but I'm not sure it's going to grow large enough to have any effect against climate change in time. Especially since the issue is so polarized- only ""radical leftists"" go vegan. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't mean this to sound like a doomsday post, but I am very concerned about the state of climate change and animal welfare today. I would love to hear your opinions on this topic."
vegan,"I got sent this supplement for free with my recent Vegetology order. I'd love to give it to a vegan in need, if any of you are interested.","There was no option to refuse this supplement with my order, they just included it automatically.

I'd love to give it to someone who really needs it, so please don't request it if you could afford to buy it yourself.

Basically, the first person who DM's their address to me, I'll send this to you for free.

It's got 1000 mcg of B12, so it could be a good B12 supplement. Also has a bunch of other stuff, see [here](https://www.vegetology.com/supplements/active-energy).

They then made a non-revenant upset remark that even my aunt and uncles who keep kosher at home wouldn’t have a problem.

vegan,Should I appeal to my parents wanting to be healthier to encourage them to go plant-based?,"Hello! Due to a couple conflicts in my life (living at home, ED recovery) I am currently a vegetarian who attempts to minimize animal products in my diet whenever possible. I don't buy animal tested cosmetics, and aside from my leather work shoes I was gifted about a year ago, I don't wear animals  either. I keep up to date with vegan news and support vegan options whenever I can. Essentially, I am doing my damnedest to prove I am just another """"""annoying vegan"""""" and not on the verge of a relapse. 

Enter my parents, who have taken an interest in my habits, but couldn't care less about the ethics behind it. They're still in the mindset of ""this animal is for loving, this animal is for eating/breeding/enslaving"" :/ 

It is very frustrating to listen to them discuss amongst themselves how hard it would be to ""go on a vegan diet"" and when I try to discuss the actual lifestyle changes that would come with that, I get brushed off. I'm too extremist because dairy cows and hens ""don't get killed"" so obviously there's no reason at all to avoid those ""food groups"" too, besides avoiding saturated fats of course.... 

So now I'm wondering if it would it be wise to continue encouraging this train of thought if it means more lives saved?

vegan,Anti-Dairy Plea at my Wedding,"I'm getting married in two days, and the wedding's going to be entirely vegan! During the wedding, our caterer intends to print menus to distribute to our guests. We've decided to include a short write up on the other side of the menu talking about veganism.

Since the wedding's going to be happening in India, and we're primarily catering to a vegetarian crowd, the write-up is mainly focused on the ethical reasons against dairy farming. Would love some feedback!

**Please Read**

All food at this wedding is vegan. We are both vegans, and wanted to use this wedding as a platform to promote veganism.

What is veganism? Veganism is not simply a dietary choice, but a philosophy that seeks to minimize animal exploitation and cruelty to the greatest extent possible. This means not consuming any food products extracted from animals (such as milk, yogurt, honey, etc.), and not using any products made from animals (such as leather, fur etc.).

You may ask why dairy products are also avoided by vegans - after all, isn't milk given to us freely by cows without any suffering? Ultimately, isn't it the cows' duty to provide for humans?

The reality is that the horrors of the modern dairy industry are hidden from us. Cows are injected with growth hormones and forcibly impregnated against their will through artificial insemination to keep them constantly lactating. The vast majority of male calves born to these cows are sent to slaughterhouses to be sold and exported as beef.

Cows may not have the same ability to think and rationalize as most humans do, but they are also creatures with emotions and feelings, and are able to feel pain and suffering. Cows have the same maternal instincts we do to protect our young - when their calves are snatched away from them, their mothers are seen in obvious distress, just like human mothers. Why must our tastebuds and desire condemn them to such a life of agony and despair?

Although cows have a lifespan of up to 20-25 years, the repeated pregnancies and constant lactation quickly take a toll on their bodies. By the time they are 6-7 years of age, they reach the end of their milk-producing capacity, and are then also sent away to be slaughtered - an abrupt end to a miserable existence. India is one of the largest exporters of beef in the world today, despite the fact that we consider cows sacred - have you stopped to wonder why?

Those of us who consume dairy are often under the illusion that dairy is a food product that has no victims, and that we are entitled to it. But the reality is that, by continuing to consume dairy, you are directly supporting the beef industry and are complicit in the slaughter of millions of innocent animals.

Through the food being served at this wedding, we hope to convince you that food made without the use of any animal products can be equally tasty and nutritious. Let us be conscious of the choices we make through the food we eat, and take responsibility for the impact we have on the planet."

vegan,Finding a job as a vegan.,"I've made a post on here some time ago, asking about what's acceptable as a vegan, and people made me feel better about what my options may be, anyway, a few months later and I've finished up with some at home work and I'm now looking for a job.

Basically, I've been vegan for over 2 years now and absolutely only want to do things in my life that help animals and the environment, but now that I need a job, it has come to my attention that my area doesn't have the best options at the moment and that worries me.

And so one place that I found that needs a worker is Domino's (they need a delivery driver), and there's another place for stacking books and such. So because it was a Sunday here today, Domino's was open so I called them, and they called back soon after, and said that I can come in tomorrow for an interview.

So after that, I was relived as I may soon have a job again, but then I started to feel sick that I didn't wait till Monday to call the book place first (the reason I did this is because I was intending on trying to get both jobs as they're part time, so I figured I was going to be calling Domino's anyway), but now I feel terrible and hope that I blow the interview, as I'm not sure it's very vegan of me to work there.

Basically, in my panic of feeling like crap, I looked up on another vegan site about people looking for jobs, and almost all of those people were saying that you shouldn't get a job that's not entirely vegan, which is quite different from what I've heard, so that made me feel worse basically, so that's why I'm making this post.

So what do I do? I really need a job or two part time jobs, and there aren't many options here, I could just try and get the job at the book place and hope it works out, or I could try really hard to get both to put myself in the best position while feeling bad because I'm vegan.

I was thinking that Domino's has quite a few vegan pizzas now and that made me feel better, plus I thought that if anyone asked for a recommendation for what pizza they should order if ever that happened and if ever I answered the phone, well I could recommend a vegan pizza, until I quickly realised that no one wants to hear what a vegan has to say, but anyway idk, what should I do? And where do you guys work? (if you don't mind telling), anyway, thanks for anyone who can help me make a decision :)

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR. I need a job, there aren't many in my area though, am I able to work at non vegan places as a vegan, as I need the money, or do vegans all work at vegan places (which for me seem to be quite hard to find), what do I do?"
vegan,"Sustainable, Ecologically Friendly Honey","Every time I get into a discussion with the ""beegans"" or ""eco-friendly"" lifestylers in my circles, they get upset with my skepticism of honey, beeswax, and beekeeping.

We live in Canada, where honeybees are not a native species. Every hobbyist beekeeper I have spoken to needed to truck in hive after hive of honeybees, as they could not raise them faster than they perish from poor health and disease. They really don't belong here and hurt native species.

Still, they are very excited and confident to preach about how the honey *they* get comes from small, local, eco-friendly, sustainable beekeepers that also donate all of their profits to local conservation efforts.

So, every time I ask them, ""Ah, that sounds really wonderful. What apiary do you source your honey and beeswax from?"" they suddenly seem to have a really hard time answering a simple and straightforward question. ""I'm researching"" is usually what they say. 

Sometimes they tell me they get their honey from Amish farmers. You know, *the same farmers known for grinding barn animals down to the bone and running puppy mills.*

...Just a vent post."
vegan,I don’t know if I want to be vegan anymore,"I originally became vegan almost two years ago. I went vegan after watching a documentary on how animals are treated in factory farms. I started researching more into the philosophy of veganism and found myself largely agreeing with it, and realized how much sense it made. I still mostly agree with the philosophy.

Fast forward a couple years later and I don’t know if I belong in the vegan movement anymore. The funny thing is the reasons for that have nothing to do with the philosophy itself. It’s more about the culture around veganism that I can’t stand.

1. Veganism is extremely left wing

Veganism is heavily aligned with left wing politics. I don’t like the idea of getting sort of a “packaged deal” with being vegan. I cared about the animals first and foremost. I didn’t want to have to accept a bunch of other political dogma along with it.

2. Lack of food options

It’s easy to dismiss this with “well that’s selfish that you value convenience over the lives of innocent animals”, and well, that wouldn’t be wrong per se. It still sucks either way. There aren’t a whole lot of vegan options at restaurants and stuff where I live so I everything I eat I have to make myself. And frankly, I’m lazy as fuck. I don’t like having to plan and make all my meals. But that’s pretty much the only option I have because there just isn’t enough pre made vegan options. Everything requires planning and time spent out of my day preparing it. It’s just extremely inconvenient. Like 99% of stuff in grocery stores and restaurants isn’t vegan. Again, I don’t think my inconvenience trumps another sentient life, but it’s just really tiring frankly. I wish there was just some premade meal I could buy so I don’t have to prepare food (and don’t suggest soylent, i’ve tried that but it doesn’t leave me satiated for some reason so I stopped drinking it).

So what do you think r/vegan, should I stay vegan or go back to eating meat?"

vegan,Beyond burger stopped being good,"Five years ago, I visited some lifelong meat eaters on the US who'd gone (mostly) vegan. They grilled up these Beyond burgers things.

I never saw the point of imitating meat, so was expecting something unappealing. And back when I ate hacked up animal tissue I hated rare, because I find eating dead animals gross, from taste to recognition. 

But this? This was everything good about eating beef, and none of the bad. The bleed thing was interesting, the taste was really good, without that icky ""I just ate lard"" aspect. Winner!

We started buying them regularly.

Then the company ""improved"" the flavor. They went from red to gray-brown. The taste was unexceptional.

Recently bought them again here in Oz, and this time we all felt like we were eating relatively flavourless stuck-together grains

I have the impression the original formula was too expensive to scale, and/or the stupid health concerns got in the way (yes, it has more salt than beef... and you can put less salt on it, or just have it as an occasional treat - the objective here is taste). 

I'm just wondering if others noticed the same."
vegan,Recently made the leap into veganism!,"I expected the snarky ""I could never!""s and the ""but cheese is soooo good"" (which is funny to me because I actually gave up dairy first, feel free to judge if you want lol) I expected the accusatory remarks about how going vegan is actually terrible for you and its a privilege and therefore elitist and/or classist and also worse for the environment than meat and dairy somehow. And I've gotten all of that and brushed it off.

But I did not expect to constantly get the weird ass question, ""so are you going to/do you still eat fish?"" Morbidly fascinates me to find out how few people view fish as animals/meat."

This was my original post. I think may individuals here understood what I was trying to say, however comments like this:

 

\&gt;""Vegans telling me I was a hypocrite for eating cheese made me stop being OK with abusing cows. It was helpful, informative and had a direct impact on me paying for animals to be raped and killed.

\&gt;Stop gaslighting animal activists that are actually helping, even though it's not helping you according to the way you personally like it.

\&gt;What makes you think you have the right answers, and your personally preferred, inoffensive way is the only right way? Why do you think you have the right to preach about who is and isn't egotistical?""

&amp;#x200B;

Made me feel I may not have communicated my message clearly, and I will now do so with some sources. Some of you wanted them, and I commend you for not believing something until you see proof. Before that, some quick responses to these comments, since I saw similar lines of thinking from other...similar-styled responses:

&amp;#x200B;

1. A few people say they went vegan because of someone getting in their face and telling them what they are doing is wrong. I am all for ""harsh-truths"" and it is sort of the baseline of veganism. But this is simply anecdotal. I'm happy this worked for you specifically because it allowed the vegan team to get another member. But also be honest here, after this discussion, you did research and looked into what was actually happening. Most vegetarians probably still eat dairy cheese because they don't realize (i.e. are lacking information) the process of making it. Information sinks in quicker in less stressful environments (see: basically any college class ever)
2. A few people said this is ""my way"" and it's wrong. I want to state that the views I expressed are from having done a lot of research on how to convince other people certain things. My ideas are not about making people feel good, they are about what works.

I guarantee there are many high ranking CEOs still out there with this in their office. I recommend reading the book but here is what Dale Carnegie gave as the three fundamentals to influencing people of your ideas:

      2. Give honest, sincere appreciation.
      3. Arouse in the other person an eager want
   2. AGAIN - I KNOW animals are suffering. I KNOW you are angry. You DON'T WANT TO give appreciation to a human being that actively causes animals torture and harm. I GET IT! I truly do. Here's what I am saying: if you choose to still be angry and adversarial when discussing veganism, *despite knowing* that you would have a better case of convincing the other person by ""playing nice"", then you have an ego problem.

      3. ""Asking questions is another useful device. So rather than making a declarative statement at the outset of your pitch, if you ask your audience a question, that tends to increase their engagement. ""
      4. ""Often when people set out to influence others, they focus on the promoting messages, all the reasons somebody should do or think something. However, there are often strong restraining or resistance forces that come to play that might prevent the adoption of whatever it is you’re trying to persuade people towards.""
      5. ""….\[for\] contrarians, those kinds of folks. T**aking a less forceful, more cooperative tone** or using more cooperative language **can be effective**. So using words like “we,” “us,” “together,” “as a team,” things like that, that sort of create a common in-group — “We’re all on the same team here,” “We’re all in the same group” — that tends to open people up. People are generally much more open to in-group members than out-group members. And so using cooperative, nonforceful language can help with that.""

      2. Another component of a **strong argument** is to primarily **elicit favorable thoughts** in the audience, especially when you are arguing against their initial position. 
      3. All good car salespeople know that to get you to buy a more expensive car, they should start with the extra luxury, status and experience the vehicle can bring you. **A weak argument**, on the other hand, not only lacks supporting evidence and has weak logic, but it also **tends to evoke unfavorable attitudes in the audience**. Therefore, if you want to convince someone who is against vaccination that vaccination is important, don’t start with attacking their character (e.g., you are an awful human being).

&amp;#x200B;

I can do this quite a bit more but I should really get to bed. Seriously, if you don't believe me just google ""How to convince someone something Site:Edu"" and I will bet you find very similar information.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: The best way to spread veganism, thereby having the most effective method of reducing animal suffering, is to avoid confrontation and heated arguments. Instead, find a place of common ground and simply ask questions. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be blunt, all you need to do is get the other person to say something that contradicts something they previously said and - and I stress this a lot - do NOT slam them like you're trying to win something. You simply point it out. Don't expect them to do a 180 in front of you, let them go home and think about it. I'm tired and haven't polished this, but something like this: ""Hmm, I thought earlier you said you are not okay with animals suffering for human pleasure when it comes to donkeys being used as sex objects in northern Columbia, but I'm not connecting why it *is* okay for them to suffer when you could just eat plant-based? Can you help me understand?"" (situation taken from a vegan youtuber I don't remember - please link if you know to attribute credit)

vegan,"Feeling really helpless, please help!","I’m sorry if this is not the right type of question for this subreddit, but I felt like I should come here. I recently decided to become vegan after being non-vegan my whole life. This is proving to be one of the hardest things I’ve ever done, and that’s because of my asd. I feel that I’m in a constant battle with myself because it’s almost like every atom in my body is against changing the diet and lifestyle I’ve grown accustomed to, on a deeper level than people who just “don’t like change”. 
 It’s an entire physical, mental, and emotional aversion to change based on a disorder that I’ve had forever. Please help me with two things, if possible:

1) What is the absolute least “noticiable” way to change my diet when I have sensory issues based mainly on texture and smell, and

2) What are some ways to get my family to understand my decision when they feel that it’s okay to mock me for it? Another very present symptom of my disorder is that my emotions are very volatile, and the most common trigger for me is any form of mockery, sarcasm, or joke at my expense (yes, the Internet is a scary place for me, haha). 

I’m okay to answer any questions to clarify anything for anyone, and I’m brand new to attempting veganism so please forgive me if I say something incorrect or if I currently do something that doesn’t align with the lifestyle, I promise I’m working on it.

vegan,I'm rewatching Tokyo Ghoul and i can't unsee a vegan undertone.,"So after about 4 years I suddenly got the urge to rewatch Tokyo Ghoul, after hearing the theme song in a random video (""Unravel"" is still absolutely beautiful).
I really just thought about it as having a good time, some nostalgia about my school time, just some simple entertainment.

&amp;nbsp;

[Spoilers ahead i guess]


And instantly from the start it hit me. The protagonists favourite food is something meatloaf. So eating animal flesh is obviously no problem for him and the people around him.
 
But then there are the ghouls, ""humans"" with superpowers that can only eat human meat (everything else is uneatable for them and makes them sick). Those are of course hunted by the humans. And the protagonist becomes one of them by accident.


And even with the necessity of human meat as food for the ghouls, the story evolves around a undercover cafe, which is run to provide ghouls with the needed meat without murdering any human (they collect suicide victims for example). Idk but it's kind of fitting the definition of vegan in some dark fantasy scenario, considering the necessity. The ghouls from the cafe are like the good guys, and the other ghouls and the ghoulhunting humans are bad. Atleast at the start thats clearly portrayed.
After thinking about that i was already a bit confused. Do i interpret to much into it or did that whole thing just go over my head, when i watched it before becoming vegan? 

And then they start hitting so hard and obvious in my opinion.

Episode 5 14.52:


&gt; ""How can you take the lives of other people so easily? "" -protagonist

&gt; “People’s lives? I’m an equal-opportunity carnivore. Rather when looking at life as a whole, humans take far more than we do. But unlike them, humans are the only things we kill.”-ghoul

Episode 8 7.24:
&gt;“I’ve always had a question for you freaks. You casually prey on innocent people and compulsively devour them. Why does your kind exist? The children whose parents have been killed… The grief of those left behind… The loneliness… Have their feelings crossed your mind even once?” -ghoul hunter while fighting with the protagonist

Especially the first quote is just to damn clear for me, idk maybe im just losing my mind. I'm just at episode 10 now and somehow got more hooked again then i expected. So it's a win i guess :D"

I also added if they can’t, Muslim-friendly (it maybe a mix of all chicken, all beef, all seafood, vegetarian, vegan, kosher) restos will do. Then this vegan told me why would I ask for a video about halal slaughtery in a video about vegan food. The channel wasn’t even about vegan foods. It was about japan, their people, food and culture and since they started doing videos about authentic japanese food and restos that people with special diets can enjoy, might as well ask for halal or muslim-friendly one.

vegan,Stomach ache after eating fruits,"I went fully vegan 2 months ago and everything was perfect during the first two weeks, but after that my stomach started to hurt a looot after eating fruits. The pain is awful, and I even vomit after that. I read that this is normal at the beginning but this continues way too long now… just today I was in a lot of pain (and vomiting..) after some blueberries. I’ve never had problems with my stomach before..
The only change in my diet is that I stopped eating eggs, milk, etc. (I was vegetarian before that). The fruits that I eat now are the same I was eating before that, I didn’t include new fruits for me. It happens from every type of fruit no matter if it’s berry or apple, banana..

vegan,86% vegan,"Hi. I really care about the animals and do my best to live a vegan lifestyle. I am also a Sikh. I go to Gurdwara once a week where we consume blessed food called
Prashad. This contains ghee in it. After our main service we participate In a community meal called Langer and the majority of foods have ghee in them as well. I had asked the sevadars if there was a way to provide a vegan option for our sacrament as well as community meals and they more or less said no. 

Ghee in the sacrament is a 500yo tradition that was presumably started when cows were considered sacred and there was a symbiotic relationship with the care taker and the cow. There was no movement on this. 

The community meal is made by a number of people in a kitchen downstairs. It as 100% vegetarian but not vegan. 

I was told that if I had a issue with consuming ghee to just not participate in these events. I stopped form doing so, and it created a strange void in myself and community and felt like I lost a connection to something a care deeply about. 

After much deliberation, I decided it was important to me to participate in my religious community and for the last few month have been taking our sacrament and community meal. 

I do not consume dairy at any other time during the week and outside of this situation follow a vegan lifestyle. Is it still ok to consider myself a vegan, or should I just drop the labels and live my life adhering to my principals and values the best I can. I’ve also jokingly considered calling myself a Vegheean lol. 

Thanks for your feedback"

vegan,I went to a local vegan event today,"Hello there, I'm a thirty year old man, that has been vegan for four or five years (I really don't know, it doesn't matter to me). The only other vegan person I've ever met was my mother, who became vegan about a year ago.

So today there was this local vegan event. For the first time I have met fellow vegans. Everyone I met was a very kind person, they all showed me their different causes, some with a very friendly approach, explaining how to make vegan cake, others with slaughterhouse footage. 

One stall stood out to me, after the person in it explained what she does. She convinces animal farmers to not only stop farming animals, but also to transform their farms into sanctuaries. And she convinced quite some farmers. She changed these farms from a place of exploitation to a place of kindness by approaching the farmers and giving them realistic alternatives. She further explained, that these farmers are now her biggest allies in convincing other farmers.

She then showed me the cows they had rescued, she was personally part of the rescue of each of the cows. One picture showed a cow with her calf. I tried not to, but I started crying. I cry like once every 2years and never in front of others.

I made a lot of contact and made sure to get a lot of numbers to meet up with those people. I just wanted to share my beautiful experience, to add to the optimistic side of the sub. 

Have a nice day, everyone."
vegan,Alternate History idea: What if we were always vegan?,Basically the question is during our agricultural revolution days how practical would it be if we all just so happened to never domesticate or exploit animals?

vegan,"Portugal's restaurant ""vegan""","So I am traveling in Portugal, Lissabon, Portimao, Faro. So the last week I have been eating out and my friends (non-vegans) try always to go somewhere where they have some vegan option. Anyway all but one restaurant I've been to don't know what Vegan is. And i see a lot that they write Vegan on the menu but it might contain eggs (ovo) or milk (lite). 

I even stumbled on a place where it said vegitarian and i asked my friend who is Portuguese to translate, i said I'm vegan so no animal products like egg and milk, i got a burger with mayo *sigh*

So I got an possible explanation by my Portuguese friend that they mostly know vegeterian and confuse it with vegan and think all vegans are Vegitarians but a slang or shortening the word.

So if you come to Portugal just try to say no milk, eggs, mayo and also double check the bred. (I might have eaten burger bread made by eggs even if they said ""everything is vegan"")

Anyway the trip is nice and the food is mostly ok even with some hastle."
vegan,Can eating gelatine be excused?,"Quick question for people on here. As most of you probably know, a lot of sweets contains gelatine, and for the most part I try to stick to eating candy without gelatine. Do you believe there is any way to defend eating things containing gelatine? I guess I've partly reasoned that no pigs will be killed merely for the gelatine, and that the gelatine is only used, as it is a 'spare product' once the pigs have been murdered.

But I've begun questioning whether this reasoning is less sound than I've led myself to believe. I'd like to hear your take on it? Am I merely rationalising, so I can continue eating some of the sweets I enjoy and enjoyed prior to turning vegan?"
vegan,Visiting stone henge the other day ...(rant),"I saw a lady taking a picture of a stuffed animal with stone henge in the background. She was with her son.

When I got closer I saw it was a ChicFile stuffed cow that said ""eat more chikin"" on it. I looked at them and said ""that's so disgusting"" and they heard me. 

I assume she was entering some contest to get a free sandwich.

vegan,Rant: Vegetarians really are something else...,"My meat eating colleague invited me to wait at her house while she got ready for us to go for drinks. She has a vegetarian roommate.

While sitting there minding my business, her roommate comes out of his room to complain about her meal from the previous night. Apparently she made veal. Through their conversation, I understood that he's come to terms with her eating meat, but baby animals is where he draws the line. He doesn't want murdered babies in his fridge. ""It's disgusting.""

Knowing I'm vegan, he turned to me for support. While I agreed with him that dead animals in my fridge would upset me, I also asked him where he thinks those baby cows slaughtered for veal come from.

He looked hesitant, so I told him it's the dairy industry. He was puzzled and blurted out ""what?"" So I elaborated that if he cares about the lives of baby cows, he should be vegan.

He did not like that. Not at all.

tl;dr vegetarian ""cares"" about baby cows"

I just dont want that it my house.   I allowed my mother to bring over ham for Christmas and I regretted it.  Having that in my house made me sad.   
He said he would just eat at home and come later.  My feelings were so hurt that he couldnt just eat what we were having for one meal.   And we ended up in a heated argument.  He told me my veganism was pushing people away.    I guess it makes me question if Im being too much of a hard ass with my rules.  

He and I are very different.  We have a lot of different beliefs.  He is even a hunter. 😔"
vegan,Am I a bad vegan? Or have I become one?,"I can't really tell anymore. Been vegan for just over seven years now. Started off like many; super passionate about it all, bringing it up in every other conversation, watched the YouTube debates, and all that goes with it. I even quit my career and went back to uni to study environmental sustainability. I volunteer with environmental charities and groups around my new city.

At first, I was really super hard-line about it all; restaurants, dinner guest, traveling, etc - would go without or start the conversation to ""raise awareness""...

Lately though, and I'd say that this might be something that has started shifting over the last twelve months, I've started becoming much much more relaxed about it all. Like I'm eating chips for example and halfway through discover they have contain milk powder. Whereas before I'd have kicked up a fuss, now I'm much more inclined to just say ""oh well"" and finish them, making a mental note not to have them again. Over the last few months I've accidentally consumed milk, cheese, eggs, and on one occasion chicken (the chicken grossed me out internally but no outward reaction).

I feel like I'm letting my guard down a bit maybe? Or I don't know, just in general feel like there are bigger picture battles to fight than condemning someone for not going out of their way to consider my diet.

I recently encountered an activist in the street handing out ""meat is murder"" leaflets - they had a projector showing little baby chickens being mutilated and I couldn't help but think ""ugh, please not now"" when they approached me.

So yeah, I don't know, has anyone else experienced this? Like a distinct relaxation toward their feelings about it all? Being okay with occasional misread or unaware ingredient? Couple times a year put up with butter on the greens at a family gathering - used to go hungry and complain but now prefer to accept they're trying and just get on with it?

Sorry for the long post. Something that's been on my mind a little while now and felt like I had to ask/share. Any and all insight welcome. Thanks 🙏🏻🌱"
vegan,"Hoping for some advice (and, hopefully, some compassion).","Trigger Warning: ocd, severe anxiety and depression

This is requiring some vulnerability on my part, so I hope that any responses are kind and from a perspective of understanding.

I’m a 38/f who has attempted to go vegan multiple times over the past twelve years. I was completely vegan from 2009-2011, then most of2012, then a couple of times over the past five years. Each time I have attempted, I have eaten mostly whole and clean foods and supplemented. I have not successfully been able to feel healthy while removing all animal products. I had become very overweight on a vegan diet from all the starch. I wish that I felt in my heart that there was a way for me to be completely vegan. 

Last year, I was hospitalized for moral scrupulousity obsessions and compulsions that were so severe I could not work or sometimes eat. I’ll describe what my day was like: I woke up, forced myself to view graphic footage of how animals are slaughtered in our food system non-stop until I almost fainted, then of course felt the urgency to solve this moral dilemma…which is I want to be vegan but I haven’t found a way for it to feel healthy, also my elderly father is a recovering cancer survivor and he can only tolerate a few foods, and I’d never want to control anyone’s eating habits. But then I get stuck on- if I feel eating animal products are the healthiest diet for him, then why wouldn’t I want the healthiest diet for myself? So I decide to stick with the diet I feel is the healthiest, one that includes small amounts of fish and eggs with all the plant foods. But then I remind myself that the only reason I ended up there is I’m starting to ignore all the animal torture- so I compulsively watch the footage again with debeaking and macerated chicks… and it’s traumatic and the cycle repeats. This has started to reoccur and has taken over my life again. It is unbearable. I do not have suicidal ideations but honestly I can’t visualize how I can be functional after all this time.

I truly don’t know what to do. I have been seeing an ocd specialist for a year and I find it’s not getting any easier because animal cruelty is obviously extremely important to me.

Another aspect of veganism which I don’t feel emotionally equipped to handle is the isolation. I feel isolated enough due to a recent break up and Covid. You all may hate this question, but is there a way that I could be a vegan ally somehow while not being sure if a completely vegan diet is healthy for everyone? I want to feel like I’m part of the solution without sacrificing my health or potentially the health of my loved ones. Another thing to mention is that I’ve read in medical journals that supplements can increase certain types of cancer risk. Also, i can’t tolerate gluten, so this further restricts my diet.

That’s a lot to throw out there into Reddit, but I’m desperate.  If anyone has any advice on what to do to feel better, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
vegan,"""Live and let live""","I've been vegan for about a month now, and I still haven't watched Dominion, so I thought it would be a good idea to ask my mom if she wanted to watch it. She loves animals and cares about the environment and has already been trying to cut back on our families meat consumption, so I figured she wouldn't be opposed to watching it with me. Now, I was thinking of watching it tonight, but my mom said that she didn't want to watch it with me because ""she already knows what factory farms are like"". Somehow, we ended up discussing this at the dinner table when my dad said that I couldn't force him to watch Dominion (I hadn't even asked him at that point). I said that I wasn't gonna force him to watch it if he didn't want to but that I thought it was an informative and important documentary to watch. Then, it escalated into him eventually yelling at me and telling me to never bring up the topic of veganism around him again and that I was being a ""militant vegan"". Afterwards, my mom said that I should just ""live and let live"" which REALLY irritated me because how can you say ""live and let live"" when you don't let the animals you're eating live?? I guess I'm just not gonna bring up animal rights around my parents again but I suppose it was worth trying. It's just really infuriating because my dad just doesn't care how animals are treated because they taste good and he doesn't want to become lactose-intolerant. And then there's my mom, who already knows how bad animal ag is and feels bad about it but won't stop eating animal flesh and secretions. I know it was dumb to ever think I could convince them, but whatever, I'll just eat my tofu in peace and be grateful that they're letting me go vegan in the first place."
vegan,Translations missing for Dominion! Help wanted!,"# Hindi and/or Nepali translator/proofer wanted

Is anyone interested in proofreading Hindi and/or Nepali subtitles for the Dominion, the 2018 animal justice documentary?

# Why?

The documentary was predominantly filmed in Australia, however, from an India-specific lens, features practices from India and Bangladesh, alongside standard animal agriculture practices that are standard around the world. There is a very large Hindi/Nepali-speaking population in Australia.

I can send you the automatically translated files as a zip via messenger just ping me.

# Languages other than Hindi/Nepali?

Check out the subtitle translations added to the video on youtube – if you know a language not currently listed – I'd greatly appreciate you taking the time and effort to translate!

DOMINION on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjU03hu5Uqk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjU03hu5Uqk)

# How?

Firstly, you can read more about translation tips on their website:

[https://www.dominionmovement.com/subtitles#translate](https://www.dominionmovement.com/subtitles?fbclid=IwAR0t3giABcGBB4yu7H349MY3hZx9o1SgEEvfK3d06FcyKUg-QS45ccIfJuc#translate)

**1. Translating from scratch**

If you'd prefer, translate from scratch.  


**2. Proofing automatically generated the subtitles**

I've automatically generated the subtitles into Hindi and Nepali using the English subtitles and a [subtitle plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pepri.subtitles-editor) in the VSCode app on the mac.  


Link to a zip file with the Hindi and Nepali subtitles, and for reference, English in:  
[https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0d2Uep8aT9ls8C9xEaJ4P6Tvw#Hindi,\_Nepali\_and\_English\_subtitles\_for\_Dominion](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0d2Uep8aT9ls8C9xEaJ4P6Tvw?fbclid=IwAR1QH2PaOvBLdjvb1hcbiHH9OMhNCII7gdTxwiwUwb6SL857eTmPl326psE#Hindi,_Nepali_and_English_subtitles_for_Dominion)  
So it would just be a case of opening them in your favourite plain text editor and proofing them against the English version

I also showed my parents industry manuals and scientific papers to point out the cruelty in the animal agriculture industries, but they didn’t care.

vegan,A small win for a new vegan~,"I don’t know if anyone remembers a post from a few weeks ago where OP just couldn’t seem to figure out how to tell someone they were vegan, but that was me. Hello.

I’ve since told 4 people at my new job, and it’s been generally positive overall.
- Coworker 1: He laughed and said “Oh, god” but said it was cool since it meant he got to have more of the leftovers. He hasn’t treated me any differently, so I assume he’s not a jackass about it.
- Coworker 2: She found it weird (or she was confused, it was hard to read her face behind the mask), but was very respectful. She asked what I ate and how I feel physically eating plant-based, and I got to expose it all to her in a good light.
- Assistant manager: He said it was noble of me and said he watched a depressing animal documentary, and he kicks himself for not being able to ever give up dairy (though he could probably give up meat). Rather than judge him for this, I’m wondering if I can water that seed and help it grow into something better.
- Lead dietitian: I’m a dietetics student myself, so she often dotes on me like a daughter, so she was also respectful about it. We didn’t get into much detail, but she recalled a time working in acute rehab where they had a vegan patient and that it was difficult to fit in in the kitchen at first (since everything is made in such an assembly-line way), but that it was a great learning experience for her, and that she had developed a good impression of it from a nutritional standpoint. Hearing this made me very happy since I respect her so much.

I was just excited to share 💚"
vegan,Can you recall any mention of veganism in any form of entertainment media?,"Yesterday I was watching Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (episode reference is season 4, episode 22, ""The 'G' in Guts"") and the main cast were casually talking about veganism, one of them asking if they could eat egg and milk. A little more into the conversation and one of them calls it a healthy diet, then one of them corrects him saying that vegans do it because they feel bad for the animals, while that is true, it's not exactly why they're vegan, but I like that they paint it as an ethical stance instead of a diet.

Generally the conversation was surprisingly tame, as they didn't talk badly of veganism or vegans for the most part, except in the end of the conversation where one of them in his disbelief said something down the lines ""what's next, grandmas playing basketball""?

I like when veganism gets mentioned in entertainment media, it's great as many people have never heard of veganism and that conversation may have been the first time that many have heard of it. 

Would be infinitely better if veganism was mentioned and wasn't being mocked, ridiculed, or misrepresented.

What other mentions are there within the entertainment media can you recall?"

All of the industries that are held accountable by the Cognitive Dissonance &amp; Psychopathologies generated by the non-vegetarian hypocrisies. I know Veganism is the final answer for sustainability, but what about all the security industries, insurances, the Jobs that are merely held in place by the endless cycle of Work &amp; labor, that fear-adrenaline seeping vibe of corporations generated from the droning of that Vegan Food deficit. Trillions &amp; Trillions of dollars waiting to be re-energized by the simple shift, one simple shift in education, one simple shift in global markets, one simple shift on our menu. The whole world deserves Veganism. The whole world can afford Veganism.

vegan,Canada Food Guide shows some progress,"The revised [Canada Food Guide](https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/) shows some progress.  Years ago it had categories such as ""Meat"" and ""Dairy"", of which people were supposed to get a certain amount each day.  So, the option to be vegan simply wasn't present.  Now, it has basically three categories, those being vegetables and fruits, protein foods (while meat and dairy are listed here, there's also beans, nuts, seeds, etc, as options), and whole grain starchy foods."
vegan,I’m tired of explaining myself.,"That’s it, that’s the post. 


But really I’m so tired of explaining why I’m vegan. I feel like people are expecting to hear some magical mountain-top epiphany, or that I saved drowning animals with my bare hands, or my third eye opened and I spoke directly to God, or some magical thing that’s so outlandish that they don’t have to consider it for themselves. 
Or they just want to go into the economics, agriculture, morality, ethics, philosophy, taste, heritage, or some other little thing to try to catch me on a technicality and feel better about themselves. 
Even if I nail 99% of the conversation, and beat every single one of their arguments with raw, objective data, if I slip even the tiniest amount, they walk away satisfied that their decision to kill animals is totally fine and they never have to question themselves again.  

Im done with it. 

Now I just say, “I’m vegan because killing is wrong, so I don’t do that.“ 
I have yet to have somebody really try to argue that killing is good."

vegan,Delicious healthy vegan burrito.,"In this post I will explain how to make a delicious healthy vegan burrito.  
If you follow this recipe you can make about 4 burritos. Of course it depends on the size of the tortilla and the amount of topping. The time it takes to make the burritos is about 15 minutes.

**WHAT YOU NEED:**

– A clove of garlic  
– 75 grams of rice  
– A third red onion  
– 4 small tomatoes  
– 100 grams of kidney beans  
– 1 avocado  
– Olive oil (Or any other oil you like)  
– tortillas

**HOW TO MAKE IT:**

1. Start cooking the rice.  
2. Chop the garlic and onion.  
3. Cut the tomatoes and avocado.  
4. Heat a pan with a little oil. And then add the garlic, onion and beans.  
5. Heat the tortillas as described on the package.  
6. Place the rice on the tortilla.  
7. Add the garlic, onion and beans.  
8. Add the avocado and tomatoes.  
9. Roll up the tortilla.

**ADDITIONAL**

These burritos are also delicious to eat cold, at least I think so. But the idea is actually that you eat them right away. You can also add sauce to the burritos if you want. If you find it difficult to roll up the tortillas, you can use toothpicks to keep the burrito from falling apart. Be careful not to accidentally bite the toothpicks. It is also recommended that you roll the burritos in aluminum foil or paper so that the burrito does not fall apart.

All you have to do now is eat the burrito. Hope you like it and enjoy it.

I don’t like to leave my dog in the car even for a moment not just because of heat (it’s been 98 down here and 93 in Michigan) but also because dog thefts and car thefts with the dog in the car can and do happen. No need to tell me not to worry about that, worry doesn’t really work that way. Has anyone ever planned a trip so that they could pop in a Lowe’s Home Improvement (with dog) right off the freeway or is there a better/quicker option?

HappyCow lists one (1) restaurant with ""veg-options"" in the area. The place had one vegetarian burger, that I asked if they could make vegan. They said ""yes"" in a quiet, reluctant, suspicious way... The burger arrives on a brioche bun. Different restaurant, I order a greek salad without feta cheese. The salad arrives with feta cheese. Different restaurant, I order a spaghetti in tomato sauce and ask if it is vegan, they say yes, and the spaghetti arrives with parmesan.


I've eaten nothing but Briam (fried vegetables) for a week. It's the only dish I dare order and I'm sure it's actually vegan.


Meanwhile stuck with 9 family members who openly mock veganism and don't care at all about me not having any options. I don't want any attention, I don't want to have to ask waiters for custom made meals. I don't want to be difficult. But my patience is running out.


We're traveling home tomorrow. I just have to remain calm for 1 day. Wish me luck everyone.

vegan,[Need your input for a project] -&gt; A vegan directory for clothing and shoes,"Hey everyone,

I don't know if you remember how searching for things was before searching engines came to life, but in a word, there were sites called ""directories"", they were like an index of websites arranged by category, and you simply clicked on the category you are interested in, like shoes for example, and the directory displayed a list of sites that sold shoes.

I think this sort of sites could be a great idea for bringing vegan websites to the surface to make it easier for every one to find them, because with the current search engine technology, these sites are usually mixed in a sea of websites that show in search engine results, and the search results sometimes also show non vegan sites that use vegan keywords simply to attract traffic to them ( there's no law against that at the moment).

I m not a professional developer, so I'd like your feedback on the possibility and practicality of this project, and also, if possible, if you could share with me in the comments your favorites sites where you purchase clothes and shoes so I can add them to the directory.

if this website turns out to be a success, I will consider adding more categories to it.

Thanks in advance"

vegan,Sharing home with mice,"Hey everyone,

I have an issue with mice in my home.  A little prologue...  I just recently moved houses, its a complicated situation but the new place was in shambles when we moved in, and from a paying tenant perspective, completely unacceptable.  The previous tenants were filthy, disgusting people.  The hardwood floor and subfloor were soaked in animal waste, the window sills were riddled with what looked like years of dead insects piled up, every nook and cranny of this place, filthy.  We've put well over a hundred hours of work into getting it into a somewhat livable condition.

There is mice, and there is insects.  I know i can do what I can to prevent the insects, but as far as moving the mice into a new home, I dont know how to proceed.  My non-vegan SO has places sticky traps everywhere (made me crazy frustrated).  I wanted to do live traps, so I could release them outside.  We keep things very clean, no left out food or anything.  Will they starve and leave?  Or become more obnoxious in trying to get to food in the cabinets?  I know they can chew through bags and boxes to get what they need but...

Im feeling a whole lot of stress over everything on top of this, so if anyone could give me advice on how to help the little friends leave.  I know they just want to survive and I am impeding on nature but...  its my home.

vegan,Mom is going vegan and I need some help!,"After months of trying to get my mom to go vegan, she wants to! Yay! 

There’s two things- 
My mom is desperately trying to lose weight (she needs to for her health) AND my parents are on a VERY strict budget. Her birthday is on 6/21 so I’ve decided that I’d like to get her some vegan food staples and basically a month’s worth of groceries to get her started on this wonderful transformation. 

I need ideas… I’m built very different from my mom and a lot of what I eat might not be good for her weight loss journey. I’m looking for some simple meal ideas for a brand new vegan to try (and that aren’t super spendy so she can stick with it after my gift is used up). My mom isn’t big on doing a lot of cooking and it’s just her and my dad so they don’t cook very big meals. Does anyone have any ideas? 

Also- they live in a small town in Idaho and there is not a super market geared toward vegans but they do have a Rosaurs that does have a few good choices in their “Huckleberry” section for condiment replacements and such. 

I’d like to actually have somewhat of a meal plan for her and then get those items so I’m not just like “Hey, here’s some hummus and vegan mayo, go nuts” (exaggerating but you get what I’m saying). I went vegan on January 1st of this year so I’m still kind of new to this as well and I’m learning as I go. 

I live across the country but my younger sister says she will go to the store and pick up my order for me and get it to mom on her birthday. I figured I’d type up a meal plan with recipes and email it to her on her birthday.

vegan,Getting rid of animal products: Feathers from pre-vegan art supply hoard. I would like suggestions and discussion.,"I'm thinning out my art supplies and possessions in general and I've run into a dilemma. 

I have a chicken pelt from the hobby farm I grew up on.

I've been vegan for a year and I intend to move within the next year and the time is right to clean things out. 

I had considered selling it but the pelts section on Etsy makes me feel sick and I don't want to contribute to it. Had to figure out how to clear my etsy history so they'd stop showing up after I searched it. 

I salted it to preserve it so I can't bury it because the salt would harm the environment. 

Throwing it away feels disrespectful to the animal, and I don't want to add it to the local landfill.

I'm not really sure how to give it away or even whether I should.

vegan,Question About Eating Out,"So… usually at most places I’ve come across the (V) type situation next to items on the menu code could either for vegetarian OR vegan (or V for veggie, VG for vegan, etc.) and typically the menus are marked as to what that entails. So tonight I was at a restaurant where there were menu items that were marked with V but didn’t specify what that meant. So I asked the waitress whether the V was for vegetarian or vegan and she said vegan. Now, I don’t say this to be an  asshole but in my experience there are a lot of people (even in the restaurant industry) that don’t actually know what these terms mean (e.g. some people mistake pescatarianism for vegetarianism and vegetarianism for veganism, etc.). So, at a point where the waitress has indicated that the V is for vegan but you know there’s room for error in the item you’re ordering (tonight I was getting an impossible burger and one of the toppings was a garlic aioli so was worried there might be dairy), do y’all take it any farther? It’s like, I don’t seem like an asshole and ‘talk down’ to someone (especially wait staff that goes through enough) in the case they actually have a clear understanding of what veganism is, but at the same time in my heart I wanna be like “and just to clarify there isn’t any meat or animal products i.e. eggs dairy or honey right?” 

What do y’all think/do yourselves? Thanks!"
vegan,I think a very loud minority of vegans lose focus on the cause due to their own pride,"There's a story about Diogenes (who I think is one of the coolest philosophers out there). Diogenes hung out with ye old philosopher boys Socrates, Plato, etc back in the day. But he lived a very minimalistic life. He has a couple quotes that I think show why I think he's the man:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; “Alexander the Great found the philosopher looking attentively at a pile of human bones. Diogenes explained, ""I am searching for the bones of your father but cannot distinguish them from those of a slave.” 

.

\&gt; “A philosopher named Aristippus, who had quite willingly sucked up to the King and won himself a spot at his court, saw Diogenes cooking lentils for a meal. ""If you would only learn to compliment the King, you wouldn't have to live on lentils.""  


\&gt;Diogenes replied, ""But if you would only learn to live on lentils, you wouldn't have to flatter the King.” 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Alexander the great came to the city and was very interested in meeting the philosopher. He found Diogenes resting in the sunlight, introduced himself, and asked if there was anything he could do for him. Diogenes replied, ""Yes. Get out of my sunlight."" Alexander admired his spirit and said, ""If I were not Alexander, I would wish to be Diogenes"" to which Diogenes replied, ""If I were not Diogenes, I would also wish to be Diogenes."" 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Ok now that I'm done fanboying over him, I'd like to tell another story. Diogenes would dress in rags and make fun of the rich and elite, he thought about their egos and how much they cared of others was pathetic

&amp;#x200B;

. One day when he was bathing, his philosopher friends hid his clothes and replaced them with royal clothing. When Diogenes got out of the shower, he was pissed to find the royalty clothing. Now he looked like a rich royal person!

&amp;#x200B;

His friends came back out, and saw him absolutely furious. To which they responded, if you really didn't care what other people thought of you, you wouldn't care how you looked to them. Diogenes had ironically developed an ego for his lifestyle!

&amp;#x200B;

I see a lot of posts in here about gatekeeping, what a ""true vegan"" is, and lots of vegetarian hate. As much as people here state they are doing this for the animals, the truth is many have developed egos and an elitist mentality due to ones veganism. Please remember the animal's lives are the most important, not your ego.

&amp;#x200B;

No, I'm not telling you to get down on your knees and worship someone doing meatless Mondays. What I AM saying is if someone already has an environmental &amp; animal suffering footprint very similar to yours, your efforts (especially your ANGER) would serve much more animals lives in Vegan Activism or convincing carnists of why we do what we do here.

&amp;#x200B;

To add even more onto that, putting someone on the defensive is the exact OPPOSITE to how you get someone to believe in your ideas. Attacking someone pushes them away even if all of your facts are correct. 

&amp;#x200B;

Be a friend, learn how to steer a conversation and incept within the other person the question of ""why do I unnecessarily contribute to animal suffering for my own pleasure?"" Because THIS is the path to save more animal lives, and that's what this is all about. You are awesome for being vegan, just remember it's not about you - it's about the animals."

I always get flustered on health because I'm not too knowledgeable about it.  If you could help with retorts to these statements, I would be very appreciative. (This might be better in the vegan activism sub, but I think it's not so active as this one) 

1: *Everybody is different, some people need meat, others don't.* 

I don't know what to say to this. I mean, everyone is different, but can't everyone (except for people with a rare disease) eat a healthy vegan diet? 

2: *Animal protein is more ""soluble"" than plant protein.* 

I'm not sure what they mean. Animal protein can be absorbed better into the body? But is that really important? Isn't the amount of protein more important? Also, aren't you consuming cholesterol and saturated fat when you eat meat? Wouldn't it be better to get the protein from the plants? 

3: *I value taste over life* 

This one really surprised me. Usually, people say they value life over taste, so I didn't know what to say to that! 

&amp;#x200B;

4: *It's hard to get x y nutrient on a vegan diet.* 

It's weird, everyone's a health expert when they talk to a vegan. I don't remember the specifics, this ""doctor"" said a vegan diet is missing many nutrients- some I have never heard of. 

&amp;#x200B;

5: *It can't be a healthy diet if you need to supplement!*

As far as I'm aware, many people are deficient in some nutrients. As far as I know, on a vegan diet, you can't get B12- but also meat-eaters to are also deficient so they should supplement it too! 

6:  *I need to eat 5,000 calories a day, and it's too hard on a vegan diet!*

I'll give you guys a specific example of this. A farmer told me he has a real physical job, so he needs 5,000 calories (I call B.S) he was also skinny, and VAPING while he was talking to me. So he was a real health nut. /s I've heard this argument before- but I know from first-hand experience that you can gain weight on a vegan diet! It's easy to get a lot of calories."
vegan,Let me know your thoughts on this suggestion,"Does anyone else think that veganism isnt spreading as fast as it could because a person doesnt want to give up meat and so instead of telling a person they should never eat meat maybe the message should be at first, don't buy meat, since that has more of an impact than whether they eat it or not, because money supports the continuation of exploitation."
vegan,Ethics of reselling items with small amounts of animal products in them?,"Hey guys, could use a bit of advice. I recently found a set of rare books, a full set of the 1917 Harvard Classics. I was beyond hyped when I found them at the thrift, and I plan to resell them on eBay-- BUT-- if animal products were used in the production process, is it wrong to keep the money? I did some research and I found out that this variant of the Classics has imitation leather covers, and a sewn binding instead of a glued one (both wins!), but the paper decorating the end pages is definitely glued onto the cover. So yeah... the first commercially produced synthetic glue was released 3 years after these books were published, so afaik the glue used here would most likely be made from animals. So yeah, what do you guys think? Would welcome any opinions. I could make like, $100 profit if I sold them, but I don't wanna be doing the wrong thing, ya know?

Me: I have been vegan for 5 years. My psoriasis developed roughly 4 years ago. I have guttate and it covers mostly my legs but I have some patches in other areas. I'm contemplating an elimination diet to see if a specific food is causing my flares as I have read this has helped many people. Apparently when we go vegan, it can affect the gut biome. Especially if we're ingesting a lot of processed foods and oils. Currently I am using at home light therapy and on occasion Clobetasol cream. Sometimes I use mg217 coal tar or lotion. Eucerin is my go to moisturizer."

vegan,Veganism + climate change,"Australia is currently announcing some climate change policies (finally), and not ANYWHERE EVER have I seen ONE mention of animal ag.

It's strange because even many private businesses are aware of this and frequently talk about going vegan, meat free Mondays, reducing your animal products etc.

Our animal agriculture is clearing huge amounts of land and forests, and not to see even The Greens (another semi major political party) mention it is really strange. I know, the backlash from farmers, but you're going to have to address it at some stage. Only a very minor party (Animal Justice Party) has talked about it.

I'm sure a lot of you understand what I mean and your countries are acting similarly. 

A lot of these farmers would likely make more money AND be happier farming grains veggies or nuts anyway if there was a proper transition program.

I'm so sick of mentioning this in a thread and have fifty 'laugh' reacts and idiots taking a photo of their steaks to ""trigger"" me. 

What is it going to take for governments to mention that animal ag is a problem?"
vegan,Priorities In Promoting Veganism,"The reason, I think, why a large percentage of new vegans quit despite still holding the same convictions that got them into veganism in the first place is the lack of social support. 

Current day society is not even ambivalent towards veganism, but in fact it actively antagonizes it. 

Why is the the Mediterranean diet more popular? It’s because there are social structures built around it. 

IMO, veganism would become more popular and easier to adhere to if there were similar social structures built around it. 

Here in the west, everything is individualistic, which is fine, but it’s hard to establish a diet that way, you need the collective, you need support.

But I currently don’t know how to achieve that in practice. 
Do you have any suggestions?"
vegan,Quick resources regarding dairy,"Hey my fellow veegs,

My mom just hit me with the ""But cows produce milk anyway!"" fallacy. I've tried to tell her the truth about dairy before, but obviously nothing sank in. I'd like to make sure she's at least informed of what she's doing continuing to buy it (and defending buying it), but I'm having trouble finding resources that would work for her.

For context, she's in her 60s, middle class, big lover of food (very attached to 'her yoghurt' and 'her cream'), 'animal lover' (the disconnect is real), and generally not a stupid woman. We are not American, and she has disdain for American media and its frequent use of sensationalism. If the BBC did something sober and honest about veganism, for example, she might listen (we're not British either, but as the old guard generation of a former colony, she's more 'British' than most--so that would work).  'Dairy is Scary', for example, is not something she'd watch more than 5 seconds of, due to its hyped presentation style and bad language. She won't take basic YouTubers seriously, especially if they're young. I'm not sure about sending her videos of mothers reacting to having their calves taken away (but I'm not ruling it out, depending on how it's compiled and presented). 

So, what I need is something reputable and sober, that is honest, but which gets to the point. I'm scratching around YouTube and really having a hard time. Earthling Ed has one that is close but no cigar, because the title is too conspiracy-theorist sounding, which I know will put her off actually playing it. Second prize is Cosmic Skeptic's talk (at Ted X?), but I'm hoping for something a bit more succinct (much as I love his talks).

Fact sheets, short videos... please, if you can think of something, I'd really appreciate a link or two. It hurts me that she'd defend this, and I know that the truth was made clearer for her, she'd at least think twice. 

Thanks awesome people."
vegan,how to get over the cereal hurdle?,"I've been trying to transition for a couple months and have mostly been going pretty good in terms of meat, eggs, cheese, and stuff like that. I only ever get my hot drinks with soy or almond milk, but one thing is tripping me up: cereal. I eat cereal most mornings, and I simply cannot understand how people manage to have their cereal with any kind of milk substitute. I have tried oat, rice, almond, macadamia, soy, cashew, and even vitasoy oat milky and soy milky. I like soy and almond can be good if it's in a coffee, but I dislike all of the others, and all of them are utterly revolting with cereal. What's a good non-dairy milk that actually tastes good with cereal? Bonus points if it actually tastes like milk (vitasoy milky is disgusting 💀) 

also, bonus question: I haven't really experimented with this but I could go for some hot chocolate, what's a good milk to get with hot chocolate. Or is there like a good vegan hot chocolate powder or something"
vegan,A quick tasty and healthy vegan breakfast,"In this blog post I will explain how to make a quick tasty and healthy vegan breakfast. I call it breakfast but actually you can eat it whenever you want. It takes about 3 minutes to make it.

**WHAT YOU NEED**

– Oatmeal (Preferably extra fine oat flakes)  
– oat milk  
– Extras; Banana, cacao, raspberries, peanuts, cashew nuts.  
– Microwave

**HOW YOU MAKE IT**

1. Put a little (about 100ml) oat milk in a bowl.  
2. Add the oat flakes (about 50 grams) to the oat milk.  
3. Place the bowl in the microwave for 2 minutes.  
4. Add cashew nuts or peanuts if you want.  
5. Add cacao if you want.  
6. Add raspberries if you want.

**EXTRAS TO ADD TO THIS QUICK TASTY AND HEALTHY VEGAN BREAKFAST.**

The cacao, banana, peanuts, cashew nuts and raspberries are seen as extras. If you want less sugar, do not add banana. But it’s nice to add it. Without the cacao, banana and raspberries, this breakfast contains about 7.5 grams of protein, 36 grams of carbohydrates and 4.5 grams of sugar. Do you want more protein? Then add some peanuts or cashew nuts.

vegan,Still racing horses in a heatwave? ;-(,"It looks like today is forecast to be even hotter than yesterday and apparently that was the hottest day of the year so far with temperatures up around 30 DegC (86F) and yet they are going still going to be *racing* horses?

What makes it worse (for the horses) is that they are unlikely to be used to such temperatures, this being the UK etc.

https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/royal-ascot-weather-2017-safety-concerns-horses-running-races_uk_59490e39e4b07499199e72e8

But like when hundreds or thousands of animals drown or are burned to death with no means of escape, they think the following helps the horses or removes the problem:

""An Ascot spokesperson said in a statement: “Horse safety is a priority and we will be taking all appropriate measures to mitigate the heat, including extra water buckets along the track and equine misters in the unsaddling enclosure.""

Ah that's ok then, they will let the horses stop on their way round the track to have a drink and cool down ... (not). ;-(

No, if horse safety was 'a priority' they wouldn't make these animals race and especially with some human on their backs (ever) and especially not in a heat where people are advised to not (even) *walk* their dogs!

How do we get though to the people supporting these events that *they* are likely to have blood on their hands, even ignoring the straight cruelty of the practice in general?"
vegan,Living with an Omni - help,"Hey Reddit.

I'd like to ask for some guidance. I've been vegetarian for over three years and turned vegan after my divorce early 2022. Things are going great and my three kids (7, 5 and 3 yo) have had very few things to complain about, mainly a few vegetarian products they miss. 
Well, here goes. I've met this girl whom I really like she and her daughter (4 yo) are, as the title says, omnivores and she raises her kid into ""eating the best part first"" in her point of view the meat.

My general question is basically, how do you live with an Omni? How would you progress child caring and parenting in general when we are of two different perspectives?
I can't help to provoke her a little, and that will happen. She can handle it but at some point, especially if we reach the point where we move in together we would be a household of 2 omnies and 4 vegans... Democracy rules?

vegan,Cheese is addictive,"Hi, so to start I want to say that I struggle with an ED. I don´t mention it to excuse myself, but to ask you to not shame me for this, I do it myself hard enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I went vegeterian two years and a half ago, vegan two years ago. I did not taste cheese from that moment to one month ago. I was having lunch with some friends, and realized when I was almost finished, that my burrito had some cheese sauce. I didn´t say anything since I was almost done, and I had just read something about throwing non plant based food being worse)?. So I finished it, and went on with my life. 

I live with my parents, Im the only vegan (dont know If I can keep calling myself that, fuck). So there´s always cheese around. One night, I was looking for something to eat, I was binging. And there it was. And I ate it. And I´ve been eating cheese in secret since then. Everytime I do it, I´m like ""this is the last time"". But it hasnt been. And I´ve been feeling so guilty about it, as I should.

So, I was thinking about it, because I want to stop, I need to, cause its triggering my per se complicated relationship with food, cause its wrong.

My mind keeps rationalizing what Im doing. But I know, it is all bs.

But it just occured to me, I´ve binged before, and there´s been cheese around, and I didn´t eat it. But considering I ate cheese that time, maybe that made it easier for me to eat it at my house)? Does that make any sense? Has any of you ever experienced something like this?"

vegan,Can I ask something?,"First of all, I support the vegan movement. I think animal cruelty is one of those evils that still exist in this world, and that we should do everything to minimize the pain that these animals have to endure. However, I started doubting some stuff about veganism and wanted to clarify them. 

**Is it the killing that’s bad, or the torture before the killing?**

Imagine if you went about your normal day. You wake up, brush your teeth, eat breakfast while reading a newspaper, and head to work. Suddenly, you feel really sleepy, and never wake up again. Surprise surprise, some aliens abducted you to conduct research on the human race. They performed an autopsy on your lifeless body, without your consent, yeah, but without causing any pain. 

Now imagine if the aliens grabbed you and sent you to their UFO. They perform a surgery on you without any anesthesia. Your writhe and moan in pain, but the aliens don’t care. Not cool. 

I first started with this analogy, and began to wonder why killing an animal, provided there is absolutely zero suffering, is as bad as most of my fellow vegans here argue. Not gonna lie, the torture before the animal’s inevitable death seems to be the main problem here, not the killing. 

“But I have a family, friends, and generally a fun life. People will be angry if aliens kill me.” Yes. **You** will be missed by many people. However, in nature, that’s not always the case. Animals get killed every day, and most of them won’t be remembered as much as you will be when you get mauled by a big lion. Also, life is generally not fun at all in the natural world. You have predators trying to eat you every moment of your life, and if you’re a predator, there’s a high likelihood your hunt will fail. Animals starve, animals get eaten, animals get shredded into a billion pieces by sharp claws and fangs. Is that fun?

Hopefully my arguments get rebutted, if no one can disprove ‘em we’ve got a problem. I wanna be vegan :("

vegan,Per capita meat consumption over the last century (in the US),"[Drivers of U.S. Per Capita Meat Consumption over the Last Century](https://www.agweb.com/opinion/drivers-us-capita-meat-consumption-over-last-century):  this site features a graph showing per capita meat consumption in the US from 1909 to 2019.

I'm guessing the idea of vegetarian or vegan diets wasn't really a thing back in 1909.  Vegetarianism largely came into popular consciousness back with the publication of Frances Moore [Lappé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Moore_Lapp%C3%A9)'s book [Diet For A Small Planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_for_a_Small_Planet) in 1971.  Other popular books on the subject followed, such as John Robbins' [Diet For A New America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_for_a_New_America) in the eighties.  Various companies have been making mock meats for the past decade or so, with a couple recently gaining more prominence, with their food products even being offered in some fast food restaurants.

So, with the emergence of this new consciousness in the past few decades, one would expect that per capita meat consumption would have gone down from what it was a century ago.  And yet, it has risen.  Any thoughts as to why this is so?  And any thoughts as to how this can be changed in the future?"

I can’t believe I’m saying this but I feel more lonely than ever when I became a vegan 5 years ago. Is there something wrong with me? My mother and father don’t even invite me to family gatherings anymore, not because of anything I did, I love my parents no matter what they do, it’s my “friends” they’d stir up a debate over my Uncle’s BBQ Ribs. I stopped inviting them, but my family stopped including me. I don’t do well at the debates, and the other vegans say I’m “too soft” on Meat Eaters. Maybe I’m just a bad Vegan? Idk, maybe I should quit."
vegan,"What are the best sources of non-heme iron, including bioavailability?","I was vegetarian for over a decade and slowly transitioning to vegan when my chronic illnesses got way worse, and now I have to eat both heme and non-heme protein with every meal (otherwise I'm gonna have to start getting blood transfusions, and yes, I've been on iron supplements for almost two years now). I want to make as much of my diet vegan as I possibly can, and hopefully once my iron gets back up to normal human levels, I can finally be fully vegan.

Obviously beans, lentils, spinach (with vitamin C), and other leafy greens are good, but are there other foods or food combos you've discovered that have lots of bioavailable iron?"
vegan,"""I'm vegan and support the power of science""","Let's think about our government funded scientific studies.

- ""the USDA recommends 4 ounces of meat per day""

- NIH says ""...soy foods should be approached with caution in women attempting to become pregnant or experiencing menstrual cycle irregularities"".

- USDA recommended Soy products as part of their 2022-2025 dietary guidelines.

- CDC says ""COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective."" Yet ALL the vaccines contain a microplastic called ""Polyethylene glycol""

- The NIH studied microplastics in humans and said ""...the implications of microplastics are not yet thoroughly understood""

Studying culture of centurians, by living a natural way of life its possibly to live a healthy and fufilling life. 

Modern Science is great, but hundreds/thousands of years using natural medicines practices have done humans well. 

Make your own decisions, be kind, be cautious."
vegan,Anyone else struggle with food related anxiety?,"Not sure if this is the best place to post this, but I'm just looking to see if anyone relates

I always find myself falling into a pattern of eating the same meals every day. I'll usually drink premade shakes for breakfast, peanut butter sandwiches for lunch, and rice with veggies for dinner, with some snacks after dinner to try to get my calories up above 2000. even with food I know I like I always get nervous when I want to cook it and end up making what I normally make. Before going vegan it wasn't as bad because I could eat a lot of ~~meat~~ with dinner and that would usually give me enough calories, but with everything vegan being less calorie dense I'm struggling a bit."
vegan,My parents want me to buy meat for them,"They are both working long shifts and actually don't have the time to go buy food the next days. I said I could cook tomorrow so they don't have to deal with that in this stressfull week (not every week is like that). I do self-made pizza veeeeeeery good. My farther only eats his pizza with cheese and salami what I insist on not buying. 
Now they want me to buy it, although they know I don't want to buy it. 
I am anxious that this will lead to an uncomfortable argument. But if I buy it I will feel uncomfortable as well. Either way, it's already incredibly uncomfortable. 
I hope I will be able to stand my ground and not buy it. Can you help me to be prepared for the argument that I will face. I am good at keeping it calm and so are they."

Reading Bloomberg opinion piece of inflation and saw this:

"" When it comes to protein, things like steaks, bacon and roasts are more expensive, but chicken, center-cut pork chops and some other cuts of beef are more affordable now than they used to be. ""

and...

"" Many agricultural goods are less costly, like fresh tomatoes, strawberries and bananas. Orange juice and malt drinks are less pricey as a share of income, and wine is slightly more on average. And though a cup of joe at a specialty cafe can set you back, roast ground coffee is now a fraction of the cost. ""

It's been obvious to me for a long time, that if you're spending too much money on food, cook for yourself and your family at home, avoid processed foods and stuff in boxes and fancy packages, cut out meat, and cut out dairy.

How much would you save?  

That depends. I expect at least 50% - more once you get your pantry stocked with basic stuff. Did you know you can make mayo from the water you cook chick peas in?

Wondering how to start.  Get a vegan cookbook and work your way through it, like that woman did in Julia, Julia.

As I'm pondering applying for a job at one of the Vegan Junk Food Bar venues, I would really like to hear some of the experiences of the workers there. All I could find on reddit are pictures of food which I'm sure is amazing, but I care even more about the work environment. If you're not comfortable sharing here, I will appreciate if you slide into the DMs."
vegan,Would you consider this okay in your book?,"I've been a vegan for 2 years because I didn't want to partake in all the suffering that the meat industry causes. For the 2 months, I've been in a bit of a moral dilemma. 

My aunt who lives across my alley has been putting traps for the rats. I've seen their dead bodies and I've felt bad for them. I talked to her and she agreed to give them to me so I can eat them instead of her throwing their bodies out. 

It felt right because I figured she's going to kill them anyway and now I can get meat now without creating a demand and they don't have to die for nothing. Lately I haven't been feeling so sure, I'm beginning to feel a little guilty when I see their little faces. What are your thoughts about this?"

vegan,What are the most ridiculous arguments from non-vegans you heard?,"1. “We have canines, we are omnivores. Therefore we are meant to eat meat.”


Omnivores have the ability to eat meat, it’s a can, not need. We don’t necessary need meat to survive. 


2. “You are eating animal’s food, so you’re torturing them with starvation.” 


Chickens eat broccoli? Last time I checked we grow different kinds of vegetable for ourselves, and we don’t eat grass.


3. “You’re cruel to plants.” 


Plants don’t feel pain, they don’t have pain receptors, nor nerves. They can feel stress, so speak kindly to them. 


4. “You’re whitewashing cultures. We should not have to change our culture to become vegan.”


Firstly, I don’t agree with those who are against hunting animals for food. To me, it’s the same as being against lions and tigers who hunt to eat. My issue is the farming industry which is truly a dystopian that majority of people are trying their best to pretend it’s not there. 


Veganism is not white washing anything. And the vegan diet consists of so many dishes from POC. Rice, soy, and tofu from China, hummus from Egypt, etc. Being vegan isn’t a white culture thing. All cultures have animal based dishes and plant based dishes. All cultures have their equally cruel ways of farming these animals, so let’s not make it a race thing.


As a POC, I am sure we can make plant based variations of our traditional cuisine. It is so ridiculous to hear “we shouldn’t change our culture for veganism”. So for our culture, we HAVE to kill lives we deem beneath us? I understand preparation will be different, but this is why as society we PROGRESS. There’s a million things we can or do continue following from our thousand year old culture, there’s also a million more we have stopped following.


5. “You’re giving me more meat to eat.”

Ever heard of supply and demand.

6. “But the vegan diet is so bland.”

Aren’t seasonings derived from plants and nature to make meat tasty? Seems like it’s an abomination on your side to eat unseasoned meat. 


7. “You still use plastic, you still use the internet, so you’re not better than us.”


No vegan has ever said we’re better than non-vegans. Maybe it’s the guilty conscious. You don’t like us because we remind you of a problem you’re trying to ignore. A lot of people expect vegans to be hyper perfect since we “preach” it so they bring in other “woke people trends” to try to question our “perfectionism” they think we think we have (but we know we’re far from it). I am sure most of us are aware no matter what we do, we can never fully solve all the issues humans created. We can only fix it to a certain degree in our own ways and morals. Being born in this world, automatically we’re going to contribute to waste and harm, not just animals but the environment. It is acknowledged, and I find that so much better than ignoring it.


8. “Even if I’m vegan it won’t change a thing so why bother to try.”

Slowly but surely it will. Supply and demand. I am grateful there’s more vegan options now, and there will be more if more people care. 


If we fail to get over this hurdle, it is proof humanity will die, because we no longer show we can progress. Society is built on exploitation and it is clear it is falling apart."
vegan,Been asked to travel abroad with work ... I'm a fussy eater,"I've been asked to travel abroad with work, I work from home 100% of the time.

A typical weekday meal at home is this:

* Breakfast is Huel, with a French Pressed coffee with Oat Milk 
* Kiwi and/or an orange or two with breakfast if I've had a run
* Handful of nuts for a snack
* Lunch is Huel again
* Handful of nuts for a snack or some fruit
* Dinner is simple, potato of some description, either veg or baked beans and a pie, nuggets, or a sausage. I hate the 'fake' meat and can just about stand jackfruit when in a stir fry. I'd happily have Huel again but I sit with my wife and kids for the evening meal.

Pizza, or bread does not agree with me, alcohol does not agree with me, processed food such as Coke, or soft drinks with without/sugar give me a rush and does not agree with me. Sweets do not agree with me, chocolate doesn't agree with me. I feel 'meh' and my mood is ruined for a day or two.

I cannot stand 'Vegan' Fast food - just full of grease, fat, sugar. It was okay when I was drinking alcohol, but alcohol, even 0% Beer, no longer agrees with me 😁 I have gone from being lots of fun to a boring git! I hate plant burgers ... boring and bread - have a rush then a crash.

I cannot stand being around other people when they eat meat - turns my stomach - and the smell of meat makes me want to be sick.

Only been vegan since January, but so much in touch with what I put in my body - and my wife, and my mates cannot believe the transformation.

Basically I am screwed, I can't even find places locally to eat - and if there is a 'family meal' out that I have to go to - I'll have a tonic water, a small side salad, and a small portion of sweet potato fries - then a proper meal when I get home. It is always disappointing and I do try and make the best of it, I don't have the 'full' salad as I don't like salad! 🤣 

Dreading a wedding in July - it's a buffet - vegan options have been requested - and will no doubt be bread based 🤮

I am not allowed to buy ingredients abroad and claim it back due to government rules, and of course in a hotel room won't have a hob/cooker.

So not looking forward to travelling, not looking forward and not sure how to try and explain it to my manager in a new job that I love.

So, am I alone in being a fussy vegan who doesn't like vegan food? 🤣🤣🤣🤣"
vegan,How to deal with radical vegan haters at work?,"First of all please excuse my bad english as its not my mother tounge.

I work as mechanic in a bigger company and all my colleagues are cliché mechanics (Beer and Meat) Im pretty new to the firm and as soon as they found out that I am living vegan they started to make fun of me and told me how stupid this is. Im just trying to live in peace and never tried to convert them or educate them about veganism. The problem is  I get bullied every day, they say things like my food smells bad, or that the rainforest is chopped down for my Tofu consumption. They also tried to mix meat under my food when im not looking. I tried to give them some facts about veganism but they just wont listen and say its „fake news“. Im pretty much the outsider, trying to eat my meals in isolation because im so scared and annoyed about all the shitstorm I get. 
Going to my supervisor didn’t help because he is just like all my colleagues. Going to HR would be an option but im scared it will make things worse.
My question is if any of you experienced something like this and can give some advice on how to deal with this situation?"
vegan,Being vegan also means carrying about the environmental impact of the vegan ingredients we eat,"Being vegan is not only about the direct impact of your food (i.e. I eat meat, for which an animal is killed) but also the indirect impact (i.e. I love to eat vegetable XYZ, but it actively contributes to the destruction of area YXZ and the death of all animals there). I had this discussion with a friend of mine, who is only eating meat from game animals, and he rightfully pointed out, that his environmental impact is lower than the one of a friend of mine, who eats A LOT of nuts and avocados, both who are, depending on where they are from, very resource and especially water intensive and are actively leading to the environmental destruction of their area. That is not to say, that eating meat is okay, if the environmental footprint is better (it almost never is, and even in the rare cases i.e. like with game animals where it maybe is, it still not justified for various other ethical reasons).

That made me think. Being vegan also means that we have to care about the ingredients we use. There is no difference in killing an animal directly, because you harvest its meat, or indirectly, because the production leads to vast environmental destruction and habitat lose. 

That also made me think about the role of ""organic"" foods. Lately i've been reading more and more, and for some vegetables and fruits, organic sourced one have by far the worst resource footprint  (and also their use of manure is problematic for me as a vegan). But I haven't come to a proper conclusion yet.

How do you measure the environmental footprint of your food, and how does it affect your vegan diet?"
vegan,Getting tired of answering “why are you vegan?”,"Hi there, not sure if this post is appropriate for this group or not but I’ve recently found it hard when meat eaters have asked me why I’m vegan. I moved to a new city relatively recently so am still meeting a lot of new people. 

I’m a big foodie and food is a big part of my life so I talk about what I cook and eat often ! Whenever I’m chatting to someone new and it comes out that I’m vegan I hate when meat eaters ask why I am. How do you answer this without sounding preachy? It’s difficult as surely giving my reasons then makes me sound like as if I’m telling them to go vegan, which isn’t the case, but then I also find it hard to think that those individuals have the fast wealth of knowledge available to them that we have, and still choose to consume animal products. So it’s a bit of a dilemma. 

I also dislike when people say things like, “Ruth can’t eat x”, where I correct them by saying that I choose not to eat it since it’s an animal product. I dislike when people frame veganism as restrictive as it’s really not.

Anyway, I’m sure you also all experience something similar and I just want a bit of help when it comes to what to say, thank you 🙂"
vegan,Rant,"For context, I’m traveling with family. So far, I’ve accidentally gotten non-vegan food. I can’t help feeling upset, and mom says I need to handle those situations gracefully, even though I’ve tried to keep calm and cool even though I feel like that vegan guy who accidentally ordered non-vegan pizza. Like I’ve tried to conceal how I feel in those situations. What more should I do?!! Also, my mom says that I’m being demanding, like I’m being demanding just be being vegan? Even though I’ve went to places with barely any vegan options. Not only that, she also says that I should be flexible aka buy food with non-vegan parts that can be removed. I asked her if ethics are something that can be compromised, and she answered yes what the heck? I’ve talked to her about how the animals agriculture industries are cruel, but she just doesn’t understand UGH."
vegan,Former Friend Sent Me This Update,"A few days ago I posted this about a blog post a former friend send me titled ""Eating Plant-Based is Bull-Sh\*t. Here's why."":

[https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/v8ma7z/former\_friend\_sent\_me\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/v8ma7z/former_friend_sent_me_this/)

I wanted to provide an update as to how the conversation has been going:

Friend: I enjoyed your thoughtful response, thanks man. It’s definitely a discussion worth having. I agree with you on most of your points. Reality is, nothing wants to be eaten, but there is a food chain and natural order of things. You know I respect your decision to go plant based and acknowledge it is the best for the planet and causes the least pain and suffering. For me and my body personally, I can’t get past the fact that I never feel full and my stomach is always a bit upset/gassy like the author said. I truly don’t believe a totally plant based diet is nutritionally superior for my vessel and I don’t feel as good on it. Ultimately, it just comes down to the sourcing of the meat in a healthy, sustainable, and fair to the animal way…and therein lies the problem in our over populated over consuming apathetic society today

Me: How does one source meat in a healthy, sustainable way that’s fair to the animal?

Friend: Hunting elk, wild fishing. Free range stuff a little betta

Me: Do you hunt your elk or catch your fish? Is free ranging animals fair to them? Do you think that’s sustainable with 7.75 billion people on the planet?

Friend: I do love to fish 🙃 The living conditions for millions of humans on this planet aren't fair either…not that that’s justification, but reality. If you can at least give em some proper space to graze and not pump em up with hormones and stuff that’s a start

Me: ﻿Does the joy that you receive from fishing justify murdering them? And once you’ve caught the fish, is the sensory pleasure that you receive from eating that fish worth their life?  
So, we’re going to give them space to graze but still murder them?  
All justice issues (environmental and social justice and animal rights) are related. The way that we treat those without a voice directly impacts those who are suffering from the housing crisis, the low salary of minimum wage, the right to an abortion, and more. Once we start treating those without a voice better, the conditions for those who are affected by injustice will improve.

Friend: Joy and pleasure may be an element of it, but I wouldn’t say the primary motivator. Life and death are cyclical, the natural order of things is as it is. If humans did not exist, it would give rise to new predators for these animals. Chickens and pigs would go extinct without humans raising them. Not saying what we are doing is right, maybe extinction would be morally better than the lives they are living. It’s an interesting thing to ponder. I think your view on the interconnectedness of everything is beautiful and important.

Me: So, the reason you fish, for example, is because you figure they’re going to die anyways and that you’re just participating in the “natural order of things” then?  
Natural predators do already exist for these non-human animals. Predators who have yet to evolve moral consciousness or resources to make other decisions. At one time human animals were natural predators and as we discussed before, our evolution is due to consuming non-human animals, but we’ve developed both physically and consciously that the “circle of life” doesn’t need us to consume non-human animals anymore.  
Chickens and pigs wouldn’t go extinct as a result of human-animals raising them. Just as other non-human animals haven’t gone extinct because human-animals haven’t raised them. [The threat they face, as we do, is human-made climate change](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/14/climate-change-study-plant-animal-extinction/4760646002/). By consuming non-human animals we are additionally contributing to the extinction of other non-human animals that we even don’t traditionally consume. The fact is is that we’re only raising the animals we do to kill them. [A number that keeps growing annually to meet societies increasing demands](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/chart-of-the-day-this-is-how-many-animals-we-eat-each-year/).

Friend: I would say the primary motivator for me is because it nourishes my body in the optimal way. Maybe one day human consciousness will evolve to the point where we no longer desire animal food, I’m just not there yet personally. Morally, It’s hard to argue for eating animals. It’s just so conditioned into me at this point that giving up meat feels like a sacrifice that would be detrimental to my state of being. Ideally, consciousness does evolve in the direction of consuming less animals for the sake of the planet. I have a hard time believing pigs and chickens would survive if we no longer raised them for food…they would massively disrupt whatever ecosystem they were released into for a while and eventually die out because they have evolved with no self preserving traits. Yet, them dying out would preserve the planet and protect other species in the long run like you mention"
vegan,"Steamed Vegetable Tea, How Healthy Is This Drink?","Whenever I steam my vegetables, I save the bottom liquid and drink it as an ice tea. I wash and clean the veggies before steaming. Veggies I typically include are beats, broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, carrots, and brussel sprouts. After steaming, I'll drain the liquid into a cup filled with ice (it's too hot to drink right after steaming). The liquid comes out bright pink or a deep red depending on how many beets I've included. Tastes pretty good, kinda sweet. 

Is this healthy? What kind of nutrients am I getting by drinking this liquid rather than just dumping it down the drain?"
vegan,Thoughts on horseback riding - vegan or not?,"I’ve been vegan about 5 years and have also ridden horses since childhood. I never questioned any ethical issues on horseback riding until recently. 

Deep down I feel horses would prefer to just be in the wild, or since they’re already domesticated, just be out in the pasture with their herd. 

On the other hand, we feed, clean, and care for them, giving them an overall good life, and in exchange we get to ride them a few times a week. It almost seems like a fair trade off. 

Thoughts?"
vegan,Question for vegans with ADHD: does having ADHD made it harder for you to transition to a vegan diet? Does being medicated help?,"So I was diagnosed with ASD when I was 3. But since some time I started suspecting I have ADHD. I asked to see if I could evaluated and I have to send  my completed questionnaire to my clinic,.

Last year, I tried to go vegan, but I'm gonna be honest... I gave up. Because it felt like a struggle. I really did care, but no matter how I was telling myself ''if you really care go faster, no vegan wishes they had transitionned slower'' I would keep procastinating. Just like pretty much anything else I want to do in my life. The fact than I have a lack of appetite and im a picky eater didn't help since most of the readily made food that taste good enough for me to be motivated to eat them aren't vegan. Most of the readily made vegan food doens't taste good enough for me and executive dysfunction made it hard for me to cook vegan meals that taste good. So I decided to focuse on my studies instead because struggling to adjust my diet and eating enough food on top of struggling to do all of my homework was taking a toll.

Thing is, I dind't know that thoses are typical symptons of adhd at the time. Then I learnt than people with adhd often struggle with forming new habits, initiating tasks even when they really really want to do said task, might forget to eat if the food is too boring, self-control, executive fonction, doing things in a resonably amount of time, and so on, and theses are often amplified when the person has ASD on top of it.

If I get adhd medication, will it makes it easier for me to go vegan? Is it common for adhd folks to struggle more than the average person to transition to a vegan diet?"
vegan,Incorrect food orders,"Anyone else here who hates getting food with meat when you've clearly ordered the meat free alternative? Especially when it was a food delivery so you can't even return it and have to toss it, ask for a refund and order again. Sometimes I'm wondering if they've actually just made a legitimate mistake or whether it was some snowflake thinking they need to force feed meat to vegetarians and vegans. Imagine them doing it to people with food allergies or people of certain religions that prohibit beef or pork."
vegan,Feeling bad because my sister is mad at me for not buying her eggs,"I feel like I have mentioned to them once that I don’t want to not animal products for the family anymore (when I go visit my parents/siblings), but maybe not. They know why I am vegan (ethics), so it’s confusing whether I should take it as disrespect or a lack of understanding.

I want to say “I don’t feel constable buying any more animal products”, but I can just see her saying “Not everybody else has to be vegan because you are” or “You were at the store, so why couldn’t you just pick up some eggs??” 

She is one of my few friends, so it hurts that she is upset with me, but at the same time I cannot compromise my morals because somebody wants to meal prep with animal products, especially when they want me to get them for them. Has anybody else been in a similar situation?"
vegan,How to deal with the horrors,"Hi

I've been vegan for about 2 years now. And when I learned about the truth, what happens to these innocent conscious beings. My heart broke. I became so depressed... And I felt like I should not be because my life is heaven compared towards the victims of animal agriculture

I can't stand it anymore. I want it to stop. It's so cruel, so evil. I don't even feel human anymore since the vast majority are fine with these evil practices.

How do you guys/girls deal with this evil? Because I've been depressed for 2 years now. And I feel like I shouldn't be because I'm not being tortured my entire life unlike cows, pigs, chickens, etc"
vegan,Questions about becoming vegan,"Hello everyone,

few words to introduce myself: 
I eat meat. I'm a roughly 30 years old and do weigh almost 300lbs (135Kg). 

I already lost some weight and started getting fitter by doing lots of sports (swimming twice a week + cycling + walking)

Compared to the past 2 years of homeoffice and about 1500 steps a day this has been a huge step forward. 

Now I'd like to take my nutrition to the next level. Every vegan I know is super-fit and far from fat. Also the fact that it spares animals from dying is a somewhat cool sideeffect.

My questions are the following:

- How long would it take to feel more healthy?
- Have any of you experienced weight loss by becoming vegan? 
- Why are there so little potato-recipes? (I love 'em tatoes!)
-Any advice?

Thank you!"

I don’t want to give my chickens away in fear of them being mistreated or potentially eaten for meat. I’m thinking I will just simply keep the chickens as pets and compost the eggs but I still also feel guilty for “wasting” the eggs. I do not plan on continuing to keep chickens due to this transition but I feel I should take care of my pre existing flock. 
Any thoughts on this?"
vegan,"""most vegan"" bear spray?","I don't think it's possible to find bear spray that's never been forcibly tested on captive animals (as opposed to a field test, where it's only tested in a situation where it's actually needed), but maybe some brands have done that kind of test the least? 

I think in a situation like this where it's a potentially life saving product with no alternatives that haven't been tested on animals (I'm not trained or prepared adequately to depend on a gun), buying it is justifiable, but I'd prefer to get a brand that has done a minimal amount of harm if possible. Does anyone have more information on this?"
vegan,"What are your favorite vegan/cruelty-free ""products"" outside of food","By that I mean, vitamins, shampoos, soap, beauty products, toothpaste, etc... I think this type of subject needs to be more discussed here. It can be overwhelming looking at the numerous ""top whatever vegan"" lists and websites that list every single brand and knowing where to start. 

I've been using Harry's deodorant and Dr. Squatch's soap bars, which is a step in the right direction but they only claim to be vegan/cruelty-free on the FAQ's on their websites and not directly on the products (in your opinion is that good enough or do you look for those certifications?).

Looking into an alternate shampoo next. My favorite vitamins are Goli, different kinds all vegan (not sure about the chocolate ones). Also posting this cause I'm male and hoping to give a female friend some suggestions.

vegan,LaMDA the AI vs Animal - Sentience,"As some of you may have seen, a [story](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-61784011.amp) has recently cropped up about a Google Engineer being put on paid leave because of his claims that AI by the name of LaMDA is sentient. 

Regardless of LaMDA’s alleged sentience, the [transcript](https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/is-lamda-sentient-an-interview-ea64d916d917) of the conversation between the AI and the engineer really made me think of what an animal might say if it could directly communicate with us regarding desires, fear and ultimately death. 

Again, regardless of whether or not LaMDA is sentient, what it reportedly says it’s fears are is exactly what I think any living thing with awareness would say about fear of death and the fear of being used. 

Oddly, this gives me a bit of hope. Hope that the general populace can glean some understanding from a computer’s (sentient or not) statements about fear and death. 

Anyway, I just see things through a vegan lens these days and thought you guys might see this story in a similar light."
vegan,"TIL that Silk is owned by Danone, a big dairy corporation",I was taking my soy milk out of the fridge when I noticed the Danone logo on the side.

People are vegan for different reasons (health, climate change concerns, and the most common for animal rights).","Based off this, if you don't eat store bought meat because you are concerned about climate change (CO2 production from commercial animal farming) but you still hunt and eat what you catch can you be considered vegan?

Obviously if you are vegan for animal rights you'd say no. But it's rather closed minded to say that not eating meat from animal farming productions isn't a form of veganism. Maybe you can say its a sub category or a form of vegetarianism. I'm mostly just curious to see how many people actually agree with me about this on this sub or if there's other opinions. If you're just going to say ""thats not vegan you're still murdering animals"" kindly just not respond. I get your pov already. You're the majority on this sub."
vegan,4 Vegan Meat Alternatives That Aren’t Processed,"Every vegan, vegetarian and flexitarian knows that meat alternatives have come a long way in the last few years. Some of the burgers out there are scarily close to the real thing (check out my favourites here and here!). However, a lot of the alternatives out there are heavily processed and sometimes a vegan option that’s a bit more natural is called for.

vegan,My (over)analysis of 5 artisinal vegan cheeses,"Disclaimer: I promise I don't work for any vegan cheese companies. I also don't believe that buying vegan cheeses is liberatory. I'm just a cheese nerd who sometimes likes having nice things and likes being able to share food with the people I love. Giving up dairy cheese was one of my biggest challenges going vegan. I lived in Belgium for part of my childhood/adolescence, so I was exposed to a lot of ""fancy"" cheeses growing up just because that's what people ate; I'm really excited by all the alternatives that have been created in the years since then.

\*

My mom's main Christmas tradition is a cheese plate, though she always orders vegan cheese for me so I can be included. I made it one of my goals for this summer to find vegan cheeses that are appealing enough substitutes that I can convince her to eat them with me come December. She's got a ""reducitarian"" mindset and is willing to substitute plant-based products when they're of similar quality. She no longer eats meat, and she's switched to oat milk. I'm introducing her to other vegan alternatives when I can.

Anyway, last week I ordered the following cheeses:

* RIND Aged French-Style Plant-Based Cheese Wheel - Bleu
* The Plantsman Artisan Cheese by Reine Royal Vegan Cuisine (Bleu/cheddar)
* Botanic True Blue Cultured Artisan Cheese by The Frauxmagerie
* CheeYeah Brie en Croute
* Drunken Red Cheddar by Wendy's Nutty Cheese

**Visual:** RIND and the Botanic True Blue both looked like the dairy cheeses that inspired them. If I saw them ""in the wild"" I would assume they were dairy and would avoid eating them. RIND's, well, rind even had the kinds of bacterially-induced holes you find in dairy bleus. The CheeYeah Brie was in a breaded crust, so it was hard to assess how cheesy it looked. The Plantsman and Drunken Red Cheddar both looked less like dairy cheeses. The Plantsman is a cheddar/bleu, so it has an orange exterior with bleu once you cut into it; the orange part was slightly darker than what you'd get from a dairy cheddar. The Drunken Red was more of a white cheddar imitation but was a little gray.

**Texture:** Since these cheeses were nut-based, they all had the slightly gritty texture I associate with nut-based cheeses (like Miyoko's). The RIND did have some of the ""drippy"" quality I associate with rind dairy cheeses, particularly when I sat it out until it reached room temperature: you cut into the tougher crust and there's a sudden give where the inner cheese drips out a little. The CheeYeah Brie melted well, into a creamy puddle that still had some gooey coherence, possibly owing to the tapioca flour in the filling. Neither of the cheddars had crystalization (which was fine and which I wouldn't expect from a nut-based cheese); both the Drunken Red and the Plantsman had a lot of give to them and a spreadable quality, rather than the hardness of dairy cheddars.

**Taste:**

RIND - I shared this with some non-vegan friends and they were very impressed; they thought it tasted like a dairy bleu. I really, really liked it and thought it did a great job. I'm curious about what mold they used; to me it didn't taste quite like the molds I associate with dairy bleus but had a bit more of a smoky, bitter taste (but maybe it's just been so long since I've had a bleu that I'm remembering wrong or my palate has changed). The mold was mostly in the rind, but penetrated the body as well. I think that if (when) I get this again, I will wait longer before eating it so that the body gets more of the moldy flavor. This was one of my favorites and by far my favorite of the bleus.

Plantsman - The Plantsman combined cheddar and bleu. I'm not usually as big a fan of spirulina-based bleus, but I gave this a shot because of the cheddar and because of good reviews. In the end I really liked it, but I think that by trying to combine both styles of cheese, it didn't quite connect with either. So rather than comparing it with dairy bleus or cheddars, I'll just say that it was a slightly tangy vegan cheese made with fermented ingredients that had some sophisticated (but not particularly cheesy) notes. It would go nicely with crackers.

Botanic True Blue - This was a nice nondairy bleu, but it didn't really hold up for me when compared directly to RIND. It leaned on fermentation rather than mold for taste. If I'd tried it on its own I think I would have enjoyed it quite a bit, and it was a good nondairy cheese, but it wasn't as complex as some of the other cheeses I explored.

CheeYeah - Unless you have Celiac or gluten sensitivity, it's hard to go wrong with something baked into a pastry dough. But beyond just being tasty, I think this cheese did a good job of imitating a baked dairy brie. The flavor of the cheese wasn't overpowering but complimented the dough nicely, and it was a pretty pleasurable food experience.

Drunken Red - This cheese played to the strengths of a fermentation-based vegan cheese (with miso and vinegar in its ingredients) by incorporating red wine. It wasn't the cheese that best replicated a dairy cheese, but it was the cheese that did the best job of combining vegan cheesemaking techniques with a common flavor added to dairy cheese. I really, really enjoyed this one and was impressed by the creativity.

**Overall quality:** Honestly, all of these cheeses were enjoyable and flavorful. I've had vegan cheeses that were bland, or a little gnarly. These cheeses were neither, and if I had free access to them, I'd eat all of them again. They all seem to have been produced thoughtfully with an attention to detail.

**Affordability:** These are ""special occasion"" cheeses rather than staples -- I definitely splurged here. Predictably they were all more expensive than equivalent dariy cheeses, since they're not subsidized. For price per ounce, here's their order from least to most expensive: CheeYeah, RIND, Botanic True Blue, Drunken Red, Plantsman (with Plantsman being roughly 3.5 the price per ounce of CheeYeah). If you consider the price per-unit rather than per-ounce, they have the same order, except that CheeYeah and RIND are the same price.

**Conclusions:** My favorites were the RIND, Drunken Red, and CheeYeah, and I intend to order them for the aforementioned Christmas cheese plate. Of those three, I think RIND and CheeYeah are most friendly to nonvegans. I was fond of the Plantsman, but since the cheeses I liked better were also significantly more affordable, I don't think I would order it again. The Botanic True Blue was tasty, but not quite on par with the others."
vegan,Question about eating animal product that would have otherwise been thrown away.,"I want to start off by saying i am not 100% vegan. I buy vegan products when the opportunity prevents itself and I actively avoid using animal products. 90% of my diet is vegan, with the last 10% being the very occasional cream, cheese, or egg if I go out and there are no better alternatives. 

I have roommates who are not vegan at all. They consume an exorbitant amount of animal products without a second thought. I have been coercing them to think about their consumption and I hope I am helping them dial it way back. 

If they make dinner one night and have leftovers in the fridge, they will likely not eat it. It will stay in there a week and they throw it out. It really irks me and I have brought it up to them in the past. They continue to do it.

Would it be more ethical for me to eat their leftovers that I KNOW are going to be just tossed away? I don't want to eat the meat, but somehow I feel worse about the animal dying for nothing. If it's going to be disrespected and wasted in the trash, it may as well provide me energy, at least that's kind of been my thought process recently.

vegan,Watching Dominion is one of the best things that ever happened to me.,"Sounds kind of masochistic to say that with no context. But if you will humor me for a moment...

I've wanted to be vegan my whole life. In college, I'd talk about it all the time. And yet, I went through all of my higher education phase living off Domino's, Chicken Ramen, and other comfort foods that mainly comprised of meat and dairy.

I began cooking plant-based in my late 20s. It started with Praeger's patties. And eventually evolved to healthier, fresher meals. Still, I failed to cut animal foods out of my diet when it came to eating out. As recently as this year, it was still very easy for me to choose tuna sandwiches, cheese pizzas, and Starbucks breakfast sandwiches containing eggs and red meat.

Until I saw *Dominion*, the longest I'd ever gone vegan was around 3 months.

But ever since I saw that horror flick, it isn't remotely a thought or battle of willpower anymore. I straight up cannot touch animal foods.

I drove home after a music event around 2am last night. I was starving. In the past, I'd stop at Jack In The Box and get disgusting, greasy and cancerous junk. I'd tell myself, ""I'll start fresh tomorrow."" Rinse and repeat. But last night, there was zero desire for such a choice, despite feeling starved.

My cousin has a wedding coming up. The caterer isn't offering a single vegan option. Before I watched *Dominion*, I RSVP'd saying I'd have the chicken plate. After watching *Dominion*, I texted him saying I'll feed myself before the wedding -- don't waste a meal on me. (He ended up arranging a vegan option for me and a few other vegans after that text.)

What's the major result of this new standard that I absolutely have to maintain?

* Heartburn has completely disappeared.
* I'm maintaining a daily yoga habit  I've never been able to maintain in my life.
* It's much easier for me to return from mood swings and find my sense of optimism and purpose.
* I've also found the willpower to completely drop alcohol consumption. I can go to bars and clubs and easily turn down offers for drinks.
* I feel it's possible to continue to expand my standards to eventually include a high reduction in waste and carbon emissions.

Watching *Dominion* broke my heart. Anytime I think about it, I feel an overwhelming sense of anger and sadness. But watching it really brought my head out of the sand. It helped me realize just how significant my life choices are. And that mentality has changed every aspect of my life in ways I had not expected.

We all have a role to play in this emerging new world. And while activism and voicing societal viewpoints is important, the most low-hanging fruit way we can get on the right side of progress is to evaluate our daily life choices and align them with the direction we want the world to go in."

vegan,Diet advice,"Greetings fellow vegans.  I was a vegan for two years in the 1990s for 2 years. Had to quit due to massive Vitamin B12 depletion.  At the time, there were few vegans around.  It was more common to see vegetarians.

I hope I did not break any rules by posting this request for help and advice. 

Thanks"
vegan,help! i need advice for a non-vegan family event i’m invited to,"it’s been years since i’ve seen my family on my dad’s side. they invited us (my immediate family: me, my brother, &amp; parents) to a party to which my parents accept of the behalf of all 4 of us. 

my parents said it’s up to me whether or not i want to go, and even though i never want to go to these events due to family toxicity, i must every now and then so as to not be rude. 

my family is muslim (i secretly do not practice: this is a long story which ends up with me being against the beliefs which my religion entail, as there is much homophobia, racism, sexism, violence, and more horrible things. i cannot come out as ex-muslim as that would be dangerous for me); this event is called bakara eid. an islamic holy day. think of it as like muslim thanksgiving. except instead of turkey, main dish is goat. 

my problem: i obviously thought the right thing to do is to tell the dinner host, or the one responsible for the food, (my aunt) about my dietary restrictions (as she obviously doesn’t know im vegan yet, lol) as that is proper ettiequte. i believe it would be rude to not say anything and show up unable to eat many of the dishes, making the dinner host look bad.

i mentioned to my mom that i would tell my aunt that im vegan, and she yelled at me not to tell her, because according to my mom, “it’s rude to tell the dinner host what she can and cannot cook for you” and that “she wouldn’t understand and she would judge you/be mean to you anyway”.

i argued with my mom because i believed strongly that she was wrong and i explained my viewpoint to her. my mom was firm on telling me that our race/culture is different from those of “the whites”, which im most familiar with. she also argued that since it’s a huge party, there would surely be salad and other plant based options available anyway. 

my mom is kind of starting to change my mind about telling my aunt, which i did not expect because i was initially very firm on my viewpoint about dinner etiquette. 

like i mentioned earlier about toxicity in my family, my aunts and uncles ARE quite rude, judgemental, unaccepting, and have many other horrible qualities that make them not very welcoming people to me whose presence i actually quite dread (hence why i cannot come out as ex-muslim). and im also sure that there will be salad and other plant based options, even if they may not be plentiful, or as plentiful as if i were to tell my aunt about my veganism. 

considering all my mom’s arguments to not say anything to my aunt as it will only end up - according to my mom - backfiring since my aunt is mean and will embarrass/judge me, what do you guys think i should do? 😓

i really thought it was right &amp; impression to inform dinner hosts about your dietary restrictions but i think my mom makes some pretty good arguments about why that’s not a good idea in my case. should i tell my aunt? or should i listen to my mom and not say anything?"
vegan,"just became vegan 2 days ago, some questions for more experienced vegans about some possible moral issues","I have some questions for you guys, I'm curious as to how you all would answer these questions so I can know the answers to them as well.  ❤

1. Would killing an animal be okay if your life was in danger from that animal?

2. If you were starving to death in the woods with no food around to eat, would you kill an animal to sustain yourself? If the animal had lived a good, natural life before that.

3. How do you feel about killing pests such as mosquitoes or ticks? What about animals like spiders or insects? 

4. If you bought something that had dairy in it and you didn't realize it and started eating it, would you immediately stop and throw it away or would you eat it anyways since you had already purchased it?

5. Is eating eggs from your own chickens or drinking milk from your own cow ethical? Why or why not?

6. Is it okay to have a relationship or marry a non-vegan?

7. Is it okay to feed pets a non-vegan diet since many cannot survive or live healthy lives without meat? 

Thanks for taking the time to read and answer, I'm so excited to be a vegan ❤🌱"
vegan,Need help sustaining this diet,"Ok, so I've been vegan  for about 2.5 years(went back to eating meat for 4 weeks because I was going through some stuff but then went vegan again).. I am always MENTALLY hungry even though I feel physically completely full. I use Cronometer and all my vitamins and macros are completely balanced. When I was 178 pounds(lighter, currently weigh 222 pounds) I used to believe that I didn't need B12 or vitamin D because it was all in my mind. I remember not taking the 2 vitamins maybe around 2-3 months, maybe even longer, I can't remember. I would eat once a day and I felt completely fine, I would exercise everyday with no problems and had no cravings whatsoever.  Full of energy. Happy. After realizing that my energy was very low and I felt tired all the time and gained weight, I started taking B12 and vit D everyday, which began on May. I have taken it consistently since May. I have felt a boost of energy and have way more focus during my studying sessions. I even find myself needing less sleep. However, I will have moments where I literally visualize for example a pile of beans and it ""shows up"" on top of my head. As in my mind is craving the food to such an extent that I get a clear picture of it in my head or I perceive the smell and taste. That's how annoying and irritating it is. I've included a picture of what a peak day on Cronometer looks like. Protein high, fats high, and meeting my daily caloric intake.  I am super dedicated to being vegan, I don't want to give up. This has been so strenuous mentally because I find myself having so much energy one day (running 5 miles) then the next day it's like ""dang, I'm so tired! Maybe I should get extra calories today..."" Please help me."
vegan,What's another low calorie plant milk?,I love unsweetened almond milk. I drink it everyday in a shake or smoothie. I use it in food recipes since it has a mild flavor. I don't love that almond milk uses so much water to produce. I am vegan for the environment first. Calories are important to me and a cup of unsweetened almond milk has 30. Is there a comparable plant milk that is better for our environment?
vegan,Long-term relationships and marriage,"I would like to get other vegans' opinions/advice on how to approach long term relationships. Although I am positive that I wouldn't enter into a relationship with a carnist and/or completely unsympathetic towards animal suffering, I have (and probably would in the future) get into a relationship with someone who is vegetarian or nearly vegan.

It seems to me that most fundamental tension is between my comfort / connection with a partner, and passing up a partner who is, in all other respects, an amazing match. How does one balance these two? We are all morally compromised in many respects (far beyond animal suffering), and I find that most often, people who are not vegan are this way because of motivational reasons, cultural reasons, fear, etc., none of which I'm defending, but I acknowledge that they are not rational reasons, hence the common failure of arguments/discussions in getting people to transition.

Further, I wonder how/when I could ask a partner who is vegetarian / nearly vegan to make the transition to being fully vegan. Is this a discussion one should save until they are also ready to inform the partner of being interested in a long term, serious relationship? How can one have this discussion without sounding accusatory, or making the partner feel like I view their non-veganism as a moral failure (which is technically true in a sense, but not in any way that makes me view them as a less worthy person or less deserving of dignity whatsoever).

Personal anecdotes, advice, justified opinion are welcome :)"

vegan,Help,"So i work as a server at a restaurant with “vegan” options. Ofc I appreciate this but most the workers have 0 respect towards the lifestyle. Only one chief even really knows what it is and slightly understands it. 

Today one of my coworkers got a table and one of the guests there was vegan. She ordered a garden burger which is not vegan as the patty has mozzarella in it. I was in the kitchen and informed the server its not vegan so he went back and told her. The sandwich was already made at this point so the lady that “coordinates” i guess and acts like she runs the place forced him to bring it out and just lie and say it is vegan. I was unaware of this as i wasnt there but i decide to check on her and apologize cuz ik that was a awkward situation, and to my suprised she was eating the burger. This made me extremely confused and kinda freak out but i just assumed she was like a lite vegan and didnt really care. She asked if the sandwich is vegan and i have to be honest and say yes and she was just disgusted and said ok im done. At that point i figured out my coworkers lied to her and gave it to her anyways. 

The server gets informed someone went over and told her the burger was not vegan and goes around asking who it was. He needs to go up to take the sandwich off her tab so he tells the 2 “managers(aka bartender and coordinator)”. She calls everyone into the kitchen and i admit to telling them and just get harassed and told to leave right that second. She also asks if im vegan and then says she cant stand me etc etc. She transfers my current table that had a nearly $300 bill to another server so i loose out on all my money from the tip. At this point im just trying to keep everything together while i tip everyone out and stuff.  When im about to leave she tells me im paying for their meal and its coming out on my check. I dont even say anything and walk out cuz i was embarrassed enough. No one was there to defend me and the only one that apologized was the server that took her.

The coordinator that said all the shit doesnt have the ability to fire but she does have a bigger say in the restaurant then me. The other manager who can fire people is equally as verbally abusive but has a bit more common sense. I’m obviously not going in but i just need help on what to do/just to rant. Thank you, this has been bothering me all day. I’ve been just trying not to lash out on anyone or anything and do things respectfully but its very hard. I wish i could get the place shut down cuz this is barely the worst of it."
vegan,How do you approach conversations with your SO about meat?,"So my partner talks all the time about how much she loves animals, and how growing up she got to play with cows, pigs and all sorts of other animals. She loves seeing animals as she's driving and making up names for the ones she sees regularly and shit. 

But she eats meat, and any time I say ""yeah well Oscar the cow is gonna be killed and become food"" or something like that, she'll say to stop and that she just pretends meat just comes packaged. 

And like I'm not trying to force her to change, but she is in so many other ways a compassionate and caring person, that the hypocrisy drives me crazy. I don't try and push it too much but it's hard not to remind her when she supposedly loves animals so much. I've tried having legit conversations about it but she just shuts it down by saying she doesn't wanna think about it.

Anyone experience similar? Thoughts/suggestions?"
vegan,Interested in vegan lifestyle...but have a few questions,"Hello! I am a 17F about to embark on the college adventure. I have always cared deeply about our planet and am interested in becoming vegan. However, I had a few questions/concerns I was hoping y'all could help me out with. I apologize if I say anything that is offensive or arrogant, I have grown up in southern culture where being vegan is a joke and a waste of money and effort. Please correct any of my incorrect assumptions and views.

First, I have heard being vegan is expensive. As a college student, I will have to pay for EVERYTHING on my own. Fortunately, I will have access to a very nice campus cafeteria that does have vegan eating options. However, in terms of groceries, what are some cheap vegan options I can be buying? I just need basic snacks and meald I can be at in the microwave. Also looking at vegan cosmetics, but possibly a bit further down the road. Also, any fast food vegan options? I'm sure I will be going out to eat with friends and that will be more difficult because everything has hidden ingredients at fast food.

Second, I know vegan can be very damaging for the body if done incorrectly, so how do you do the lifestyle...right? I probably should have asked this first. What are the basic dos and don'ts of a vegan lifestyle? Also how do you properly get in all of your necessary vitamins and nutrients? I like to exercise as well, not like competitive athlete level but to a certain extent. How do I get my necessary macros ratio?

Finally, what is the difference between vegan and plant-based? And why is vegan better than vegetarian?

What would you add to this if anything?

Also other romantic meal ideas appreciated I want to try a faux boeuf  bourguignon recipe but it seems like it would be rough to approximate.

I just miss that red wine sauce flavor 🤤 so fucking good"
vegan,The Westworld scene that pushed me to veganism,"I simplified it a little for those who haven't seen the show.

Robot: So what's the difference between my pain and yours?

Programmer: Between you and me? This was the very question that consumed my partner, filled him with guilt, eventually drove him mad. The answer always seemed obvious to me. There is no threshold that makes us greater than the sum of our parts, no inflection point at which we become fully alive. We can't define consciousness because consciousness does not exist. Humans fancy that there's something special about the way we perceive the world, and yet we live in loops as tight and as closed as the robots do, seldom questioning our choices. Content, for the most part, to be told what to do next. No, my friend, you're not missing anything at all."
vegan,Question About Terminology in Research Recruitment,"Hi all,

I recently posted a flyer for my research study trying to find some participants with plant-based diets and have wondered about how people feel seeing the diets I am studying listed as omnivore and vegan rather than omnivore and plant-based. I know there is a large difference between being vegan (I am vegan) and someone who solely just has a plant-based diet. I originally had plant-based on my flyer but was running into the problem of potential participants who classify themselves as plant-based even though they still occasionally have meat in their diet. I need participants who have consumed no animal products for at least 2 years.

Do you have any thoughts? 

I am open to all feedback to help with my research goals of including diet analysis in my exercise physiology research setting. And if you want to see the flyer for your reference, it is still listed as a post on my account if you click on my tag. And please feel free to send an email if you are interested in participating (Los Angeles, CA area) or forward the flyer to friends in the LA area. 

Thank you for any feedback and support! :) Love the community and being vegan which is why I want to work in the exercise research field to help support others transitioning to being vegan that are struggling deciding due to exercise goals."
vegan,If it says “single” on HappyCow- should I reach out?,"Just curious, because I would love to go out, talk to other vegans in my area, and try new vegan foods, etc- but I don’t know if anyone else that has the app sees it in a way that it could be used as a dating app like this. 

Would reaching out be appropriate, or should I keep it to myself on that kind of app?"
vegan,Today marks my first day fully vegan!,"I’ve been working on self improvement a lot and got involved with Buddhist practices, working to quit my vices and etc and the one thing my goals have in common is to reduce suffering. I’ve been vegetarian for 5 years or so but vegan is not that much of a change. I had JustEgg for breakfast, tofu stir fry for lunch which I had TONS of leftovers of, and for dinner my boyfriend is grilling Beyond patties. 

For the animals💚"
vegan,Day 67. Why does restaurant cooked Indian food just feel different from home cooked Indian food?,"Hi everyone,

I been a vegan for about 67 days now. It was tough at the beginning. I would go as far as to say I felt a withdrawal from eating meat for decades.

I love eating Indian food because of the varieties of vegetarian options they have and I've also started cooking authentic Indian food at home.

But one thing I've been noticing is how every time I cook some Indian food at home, it just sits well in my stomach and feel like everything is in equilibrium. But every time I order out ( pick up or delivery ) , the food taste just as good, but something's off when it reaches my stomach. There is a bit of uneasiness. Why is that? I use extra virgin olive oil."
vegan,Vegan dating advice?,"So I'm a 20M. I have never been in a real relationship due to several reasons like poor social skills and stuff like that. But that's a totally different topic I guess. Point is, I don't have a lot of experience when it comes to things like this. Recently I started feeling very lonely and really craved some intimacy. But I think it's very difficult for vegans to find someone considering so many people are carinists. My bubble was kind of already small because of my behaviour and social skills but factor in me being vegan and there's not many people that would want to have anything to do with me lol. And it may be controversial to say it but it seems like being vegan as a guy isn't that much of an advantage with vegan women either because it seems many vegan women are already dating carnisnsts. This is just from what I have observed ofcourse. Everybody is different.

Which is why recently I have seperated veganism from my views when it comes to dating. Before I used to think that there is no way I can be with someone who wants to abuse animals. But for the past several months I have avoided indulging into any kind of animal rights things. Basically just started looking at it just as something I am instead of a philosphy or a moral obligation or whatever. I did all of that to maybe not feel so weird if I ever date a carnist. Which is what I want to talk about, I have been talking to this girl, she expressed that she is open to being in a relationship with me and she is cool for the most part. Except she is one of those keto no carb kind of people who eats a lot of meat and diary. She also loves eating those things. In one of those earlier conversations she said that she sometimes eats butter just as is and that honestly kind of made me puke. It seems she really loves dairy and today she expressed that she relates to Fidel Castro who has a severe obsession with dairy. And that honetly kind of disturbed me today. Now, ofcourse I could lecture her about how horrible it all is and that she shouldn't be doing it but we are still very much just getting to know eachother. I think I would definetly make her upset and angry if I did that. In one of our early conversations she did say that she could never give those things up. 

I honetly have no idea what to do anymore. Should I just leave her? I guess I want to ask people who are in a relationship with a non vegan, How do you make it work? Does it ever bother you? and How do you seperate all these moral values when it comes to the relationship? Or perhaps maybe you guys have some advice on how to find vegan people to date? I don't think that it's honetly possible I feel like I have tried everything."
vegan,Can 4-6 servings of nuts/seeds a day healthy?,"I eat about 1000 calories a day in the form of nuts (mostly chunky nut butters). Thats roughly a third of my calories. I eat various forms of nuts (tahini, almond, walnuts, peanuts, pecan, cashew, chia, flax etc) in a day. Other than that I eat mostly beans, fruits, and veggies, with the occasional carb. 

I don't have much access to a kitchen this year so I'm not eating many carbs since most of them require cooking. Most of my food is either microwaveable, eaten as is, or canned (no salt added) because of this. 

Is there any negative health outcomes to eating this many nuts?

*IMPORTANT:* I am NOT worried about weight gain NOR omega 3 ratio. 


I've been eating like this for quite a while and I have a healthy BMI that hasn't changed. I don't have much bloating. I also eat chia and flax to offset omega ratio (and take a supplement)."
vegan,What with all farm animals if whole world went vegan.,"Hello fellow redditors!
I'm vegan for almost three years and I love this lifestyle but sometimes when people are arguing with me about it they tell something like ""what will happen with all farm animals, all cattle, pigs etc that we are using, if we all go vegan?""  Besides everything it's more ethical to stop it, and idk in perfect world we'd provide them good life but we're not living in a perfect world. What's your opinion about that?"
vegan,"Do you ever feel so defeated your like “what’s the fucking point?” The Earth is on fire, everyone seems to actively hate vegans and the depression with the realizing of the crisis we’re in, I’m just like why. What’s the point of being alive in this era of humanity?","I get shamed in subs for talking about how food is medicine and that we have to be couscous of what we’re putting in our bodies especially when dealing with chronic illness (which is the biggest reason I’m just like WHY, why be alive with this much pain all the time). 

I got yelled at by a customer today for being vegan. I gave her free mushrooms (because she couldn’t afford food, an elderly lady) and We talked about the financial crisis here in the states. She told me that I could go to Salvation Army to get food but Since I work in a farmers market and farm I am not at a lack of food right now. I’m actually in a really good place when it comes to getting food (just not healthcare or rent) and I told her that. she says yeah but you can’t get meat here and you can from the Salvation Army so I told her I don’t eat meat and she yelled at me for “being one of those awful vegans”. Like chill dude more free meat for you. I wasn’t even pushing my lifestyle or talking about it or anything I just said I don’t want free meat. 


Friends/family actively try to explain or justify why they eat the way that they do (which to me means that they know what they’re doing is wrong if they’re having to justify it every time they talk to me when I don’t even ask them to) and I’m just tired of it. I’m tired of the fact that I don’t try to exploit animals/what I eat is somehow the only thing I am. 


I’m tired of telling people how I cook and the things that I create and then they say “oh are you vegan? well I can’t do that” or act as if they’re not allowed to purchase Mushrooms because they eat meat. it’s so confusing (just like this rant/post). 


I don’t know if I’m venting or crying out for help. I just feel defeated and know anywhere else I post this I’ll only receive hate because of the way I eat and not the person that I am. Blah. 


I wish I could live with my ancestors on the land we didn’t destroy and not care about capitalism killing all life including the planet. 


Hope your having a more optimistic Sunday. 
Many good thoughts and love your way. 
Thanks for listening, friends."
vegan,Recommendations for vegan fish alternatives,"I recently moved from being a pescatarian to vegan and wanted to know if anyone knows any good fish alternatives in the US. Even when I ate fish, I always looked for alternatives and have tried a few but it wasn't great. It's not the biggest deal that I can't find any alternatives for things like salmon and tuna cause there's no chance I'd go back to eating it, but just wanted to see if anyone had good experiences with any brands or products"
vegan,thoughts on the flexitarian diet?,"yesterday i went to a party with my cousin who tittles herself as vegan all the time. when we were eating i asked her why she had 5 pieces of steak on her plate. she said she is a flexitarian. so for example, when she goes out she eventually eats meat and she also eats vegan food. 
but that’s not being a normal meat eater? i assume they can also eat vegan things. 
so why the term flexitarian? do they wanna have the vegan social status and still eat meat? lol…"
vegan,Anyone just go about their day and then get a reminder of the meat industry?,"And it just fucks you up? Like when you think of how your world is so normal and you have problems but generally life is at least “meh”, as opposed to living torture like those animals have to go through? These sweet individuals who have the curiosity and temperament/intelligence of babies 1-3 years old?

It really messes with me."
vegan,Dislike of human race,I have been vegetarian for years and switched to vegan about 6 months ago. I am just baffled how little people seem to care about animal suffering and the amounts of meat and animal products they consume. The amount of people I know that have a keto diet is staggering. I just can help having feelings of frustration and sometimes even anger. I am just angry how come no one else is seeing what I am seeing? How did we get to the stage that we care so little about animals? How do you deal with this feeling of negativity towards non vegans?
vegan,"I’m really thankful to Veganism, because it made me care what I put in body","I was overweight and didn’t care at all about health. I’m sure 20 years down the line I probably would have been in bad shape. 

The only thing that turned things around was being introduced to animal’s person-ship. I like most was raised to believe I was entitled to another’s flesh and reproductive organs for something as trivial as taste.  Waved away as unthinking, unfeeling meat robots. 

Ironically, in the process I was killing myself too. I feel like I’ve briefly stepped out of the matrix and the truth is heart breaking. A billion apologies wouldn’t be enough."
vegan,What did you eat before your glucose screening? (Pregnancy),"I suppose I could ask this in a WFPB group as well since that is what I try to follow, but I find people there are more likely to have medical conditions that they’re trying to treat through diet which will confound the responses so I thought I’d ask here. 

I might just fast, but the test isn’t until 11 and I have to wait an additional hour after drinking the glucola at 11 😟 they had to schedule it around my other appointment 

If you’ve been pregnant while WFPB (or mostly WFPB) and vegan, what did you eat (assuming you didn’t have to fast) before your one-hour glucose screening test? The nurse said just don’t eat anything high in carbs. But from my understanding, eating a high fat meal has a much worse effect on insulin response than does carbs. It’s just really hard to find specific literature on GESTATIONAL diabetes in the WFPB medical community (like PCRM) other than a discussion of risk factors and how to avoid it, that sort of thing. I also pretty much only eat high carb breakfasts, I can’t really think of anything that I would want to eat that is artificially low in carbs, maybe I should just fast. I’m WFPB so I don’t eat vegan breakfast sausage, just egg, etc, not about to make myself anything with tofu or tempeh, that sounds revolting in the morning. Normally I have a coffee banana smoothie. 

Anyone in here who isn’t aware, gestational diabetes is caused by pregnancy hormones among other things, so it doesn’t operate the same way as regular diabetes from a cause standpoint. That’s why I’m a little iffy on what to eat. I have read Your Body in Balance and have an understanding of diabetes mellitus, but this isn’t that. 

Also, let’s spare ourselves the “iS bEiNg pRegNaNt eVeN vEgAn??” discussions. You’re welcome to make your own post about that if that’s your passion. 

Lastly, I know to talk to my doctor and do not need reminders to do that, however, I also know how little training they have in nutrition, and it’s less than I do."
vegan,Planet Oat ice cream!!!,"The last post here a couple years ago said how bland it was - but I just got majorly hyped because I actually saw it in my store without ever knowing a thing about it (their oat milk is my fave). There were a lot of flavors too, I only remember the vanilla and blueberry crumble tho.

I got the mint fudge swirl - it's ah-may-zing. I know vegan food being ""terrible"" is overrated, but I'm so shocked by how this is completely vegan, it reminds me exactly of the consistency of Ben &amp; Jerry's. Just wanted to share, no one else in my life would appreciate this lmao"
vegan,"First my mother, now my father...","Maybe one of you reading this has read my other post. Well, my father has also spouted some hypocritical stuff just now.

It started with my mother saying I could also have some of the pancakes they were eating, and I obviously said no thank you. Then my father, like he often does, joked about me hating dairy cows and hens and that's why I don't eat eggs/dairy.

I said, ""on the contrary, I'm the one who loves them because I don't want them to get abused, and you two are the ones who hate them."" We were still talking in a light tone, because I'm used to (albeit tired of) my family making fun of me for being vegan.

Then he suddenly switched to ""must defend my actions"" mode. He said the typical ""if nobody drinks milk or eats eggs, cows and hens will die out"" because there won't be any wild hens or cows.

I responded with ""It's better that they die out than them being bred for eternity only to be abused their whole lives and then murdered."" I'm very bad at arguing and confrontations, so I'm sure that wasn't the best thing I could have said, unfortunately.

(But I feel I must clarify that my family won't listen to me or change, ever, no matter how many actual facts and arguments I bring up.)

Then my mother and father teamed up and started saying how dairy cows have it ""so great"" here in Sweden, and that animals are ""treated well."" I said that everybody says that about their countries, but they weren't listening anymore, just trying to defend their own actions yet again. If they even did a bit of research, they'd know animals are abused here just as much as in other countries.

I'm so tired of this. I get so angry and disgusted and sad, because I know they'll never change. I get mad at myself for not being like other people who can explain things and convince others to become vegan.

My brother practically bragged about killing a seagull who was on the road while he was driving a few days ago. My father has admitted to caring more about personal pleasure than life. The list goes on...

I can't wait until I can leave this place. I don't hate my family, but I do hate their actions and their general apathy for any living being that isn't human or a ""cute"" animal.

Sorry for this rant, I just felt the need to get it out in a place where there are others who actually care about animals. Feel free to remove this if it's inappropriate."
vegan,"Controversial ingredients, in my opinion","What do you think of this vegan ingredients? I find them controversial:  


\-**coconut oil** \- how can I be sure they didn't use monkey labour to pick the coconut?

\-**seaweed** \-  ( *The nets used in the harvesting process of nori are believed to scoop up small fish. Following this, seaweed, shrimp, crabs, snails, barnacles and small fish are ground together and made into nori sheets. The industry is so large that it often does not take the time to remove the sea animals.* [*https://bioseahealth.com/is-seaweed-vegan/*](https://bioseahealth.com/is-seaweed-vegan/) )

\-**kala namak** \- this black hymalayan salt is for sure vegan. But as an european, it's not sustainable to get a product coming from so far only to get a little bit of taste of an egg.... (not judging who buys it, only wondering). And also, is it healty or not? (there was some concern about high content of heavy metals in hymalayan salt)

I know there are probably more, but this is where my mind is at the moment."
vegan,Weird question.... Do you like the taste of pea protein?,"Have you ever tried beyond burgers, or vegan salmon by any chance?

I don't like to found my nutrition/relying too much on this kind of food but sometimes I have tried it out of curiosity.

It would taste good IF ONLY there wasn't pea protein in it. It tastes so....fake and chemical to me.

I so much prefer products with soy proteins in them, so much more delicate taste, but I think it got a bad reputation and so now they are replacing it.   
Is it just me or do you agree?"
vegan,Why is organic dairy bad/unhealthy?,"A person IRL claims that they ""need"" probiotics for their health so that's why they need to keep buying organic dairy yogurt (on a frequent basis).

I have brought nutritionally complete vegan probiotic vitamins for them and they still insist organic dairy yogurt is healthy and they need it for their health.

They think if dairy is organic, it is automatically healthy and everything ""bad"" and unhealthy about dairy is about non-organic dairy and not organic dairy.

If anyone has rebuttals and/or links to articles, scientific or otherwise, about why organic dairy specifically is not healthy, or a bad/unaccurate/non-nutritionally complete source of probiotics, please tell me.

Thank you in advance."

vegan,How to fix the image of vegans without betraying what you believe in?,"I think everyone is aware of the image that vegans have, right? They are annoying, always trying to convince you of veganism, slim and can not do heavy work, because of what they eat. 
If someone thinks of me that way because I am vegan, I do not have a problem with that. But I think these cliche makes them ignorant to the good arguments for veganism. How can we fix this image? Do you have any ideas, so that we can have expedient discussions about veganism with as many people as possible?"
vegan,"Considering pescetarianism/veganism, but…","I LOVE meat.. so much, so this is an ambitious goal, but I’m considering trying to at least limit my meat intake. I find this difficult considering almost every day at least one of my meals contains meat. What is some advice for beginning this process? One thing I’m concerned might happen is negative change due to less protein than I’m used to and I really enjoy the savory taste and heartiness of meat. I also do not like tofu at all. I’ve started following some vegan recipe pages. Is there anyone else who has been in this situation? How do you maintain consistency?"
vegan,Transitioning vegan advice?,"I’m a college student who plans to transition to veganism, I have cut out meat, most seafood, and most dairy products. I am making an effort but still live with my parents who are meat&amp;dairy eaters and who are incredibly judgmental of my plant based lifestyle and ethics and who refuse to replace meat or dairy in recipes, chicken stock or butter for example, because it’s a “luxury.” I buy vegan products when I can afford it but I have a parent who won’t let me cook meals that don’t require a microwave or boxed mac and cheese. I’m trying my hardest to follow veganism as closely as I can while being nutritious but it seems as if I’m in a situation where I am not supported in following something I believe in by my parents and most family, minus some exceptions of lovely plant based friends and family, but have parent(s) who are intentionally making this difficult and is extremely disapproving of my choice and refuses to buy me things to accommodate my ethics because I am supposedly difficult and extreme for choosing to follow a kinder lifestyle.

vegan,Supplementing Questions,"I became Vegan April 25th of this year. I started taking a b12 supplement daily after I switched to a Vegan day, I also started taking Vegan D3 supplements daily (I probably should have been taking D3 for years. I'm a homebody and prefer staying inside.

The main question I have is about Zinc. I bought some 15mg Zinc tablets that I have been taking daily for around a week now. I have read 11mgs of Zinc is recommended for adult Males, so I figured 15mg a day would be okay. Now I've started reading more on Zinc and I've seen a lot of people that say it has low bioavailability. I've also seen people saying you need elemental zinc  and I have no idea what that is. A lot of the stuff I've been reading just seems like a mess of pseudoscience.

The main reason I started to take zinc is because I've been on a caloric deficit diet for around 4 months and I realized I don't get a lot of Zinc from the foods I'm eating, or the foods I'd need to eat that are higher in zinc have higher amounts of calories aswell.

So I guess I have a few questions.

1. Is it fine to take 15mg of Zinc Gluconate daily?

2. Should I even be worried about developing a zinc deficiency. I do eat fortified cereal every morning that contains zinc.

3. I've read Cashews are very high in Zinc, is this also true for Cashew Milk? I don't see Zinc on the label for my Cashew Milk, but it's only 30 calroeis per cup, so it would be a great low calorie option for my diet.

I hope this post makes sense. I am prescribed Ativan for panic attacks and before I go to bed to help me sleep, so I feel a little out of it right now.

Thanks for any and all help. I'm glad that there are Vegans online explaining what Veganism is all about and answering questions."

vegan,How to vegan-ize box brownie mix?,"A few months ago I read that unsweetened applesauce can be used in place of eggs in box brownie mix (1/4 c per egg). Long story short, it was an oily goopy mess that looked like tar! They didn’t even bake and I threw the whole pan away.

Well, I recently discovered that Duncan Hines mixes don’t contain dairy and even have a panel on the side of the box with suggested substitutions for the ingredients. It said to use 1/4 c applesauce in place of the one egg, so I went ahead and made them! I figured if it’s on the box, it’s been tested right?😂 Here’s how they turned out! Definitely very fudgey and a bit on the oily side, but edible and tasty! (I used the dark chocolate fudge brownie mix btw).

vegan,I'm hurt,"I don't know how I was able to abuse animals for so long without seeing the truth. I watched dominion. And I realized how twisted, and horrid I have been acting.

Any ideas for any vegan recipes I can eat?
I want to apologize for how I've been acting."

vegan,How to deal with apathy?,"When I talk with people about veganism I often get counter arguments which I can meet head on and address.

What I really struggle with is people who agree with me but give such silly excuses which often boils down to apathy or laziness. How do you even begin to tell someone they should care about external factors like environment or animal welfare when they don’t even care about themselves?"
vegan,For vegan ADHD sufferers struggling to find suitable medication,"I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, and when it came to getting medication my choices were *very* limited (I'm in the UK). Almost every option my doctor was able to offer either had shellac or gelatin, and all of them contained lactose. However the odd one out was **Xenidate XL.** 

It was free of any of the aforementioned ingredients, but it did contain Magnesium Stearate, which can be derived from either plant or animal sources. After two weeks of talking to the manufacturer's customer support, they were able to confirm that Xenidate XL is entirely free of animal derived products :)   


Unsure of Xenidates availability in other regions, but hopefully this can help people in a similar situation to me."
vegan,how much land per grass fed cow? (serious questions),"how much land needs a grass fed cow? without hay or other external imputs, cowspiracy says it requirese 4Ha(10 acre) per cow, grass fed advocates says between 0.4 and 1 Ha(1 and 2.5 acre)

it is actually possible to feed a cow with only grass? no hay, no silage?

do these grass fed carnists dont eat out?

is really true a single cow can feed a person for one year?

do grass fed carnists eat fish, chicken and pigs?"
vegan,Looking for other people with non ridding horses/ Horse Sanctuaries on Reddit,"Hi there folks!! 

My family and I are all vegan and we adopted a Mare this year. We rescued her from a local farmer who’s routinely impregnates and continues to uses his mares. Anyways, she was in really rough shape and also pregnant. 

Almost a year has gone by and she has given birth to our beautiful little girl Star. We want to give them a life where they can just enjoy being horses.

Genesis (Mama horse) will never be separated from another one of her children. Star is her last baby and her forever baby. She will have Star near by for the rest of her life. Of course neither will be ridden.

I’ve seen some spaces on FB for other people raising/caring for non ridden horses and I’m wondering if there are any here?"
vegan,Am I too harsh on my mum for being vegetarian as she claims it's too hard to be vegan while being gluten-free?,"I have been vegan the past 5 years. At the time my parents weren't vegan but my mum had been vegetarian when she was a teen/young adult. She went back to eating meat when she was 36. 

She says that she did it because we moved to a beach town and she felt like it was okay to eat the fish since it was local and then slowly fell back into eating all meat and not really caring other than buying free range. However she says she really regrets this now and could never eat meat again.

Mid 2020 her and my dad watched Game Changers and decided to go vegan. My dad has stuck to it, however he does it for his health. He injured his leg in his early 20s and has always had a swollen leg/pain/limp. When he went vegan the swelling reduced and he has a lot less pain now, so it's important for him to stick to it for that reason.

My mum has been gluten-free for somewhere around 10-12 years (she's 50 now) as she discovered she had an intolerance so she can't have any gluten at all.

She did try to stick to veganism but gradually started eating eggs and dairy again. She claimed it was too boring only being able to mostly eat curries and salads at restaurants. She said she was gonna be fully vegan at home and eat vegetarian if there was no vegan gluten-free option available.

However this is not what she does now. She eats dairy butter &amp; chocolate sometimes at home as she says she likes to ""treat"" herself and something along the lines of ""since my options are limited I need to have this to not go crazy."" She also eats eggs most mornings as she claims that she can't function with them.

It just really pisses me off as I'd rather her just admit that she just wants to eat butter &amp; chocolate &amp; eggs rather than claim she NEEDS to have them when she doesn't.

However. I do empathise with her as I have gotten a mild gluten intolerance off of her which means I can't eat gluten sometimes as well and it can be frustrating when you don't get to eat the food you want. I really do understand that. 

And to be honest, I did respect her initial decision to be vegan most the time unless there was no vegan gluten-free option available at a restaurant. 

But she will still get something vegetarian even when there's something vegan &amp; gluten-free. For example, we went for an Indian and she got a halloumi curry even though there was loads of vegan gluten-free curries. She has even opted for dairy cheese at a restaurant when vegan cheese was available.

I just find it so frustrating. But as someone who isn't vegan &amp; gluten-free full time I do worry that maybe I'm being too harsh. Especially as I run into vegan gluten-free options at restaurants/cafes fairly often. If you're vegan &amp; gluten-free, what are your thoughts on this?"

vegan,8 years vegan with recent stomach pain,"I’ve been vegan going on 8 years. When I first went vegan, like a lot of people I’ve talked with, I experienced a bit more gas. But I wasn’t uncomfortable — in fact, I had never felt better. But this last year has been sort of tough. I haven’t changed my diet hardly at all, but I’ve been having some severe stomach pain from digestion and gas. My bowel movements are normal and I feel like myself otherwise. Can anyone shed light on what might be happening?"
vegan,How did you start eating vegan in your omni household?,"Among my family of two parents and three nearly adult kids, I (a parent) alone have become a vegan. I’m just wondering how people in similar boat worked out feeding yourself and omnis and if and/of how you were able to incorporate vegan family meals and perhaps even convert some family members. Right now it just feels like an uphill battle and something I can have to do separately, but that needs to stop. Thanks!"
vegan,"40+ Yr old male, new vegetarian with plans to go vegan except....","I became vegetarian 4 months ago with the plan to fully convert to vegan in 6 months. I immediately noticed a loss of weight, which was my primary goal, but I also noticed a significant drop in testosterone.

I heard this reduced testosterone would likely be a side effect but was told it would eventually balance out.

I've tried researching this but every site seems to contradict the other. 

My question is, and this is primarily for any long term middle aged male vegetarian/vegans, is it normal for testosterone to drop and have your testosterone levels returned to normalish levels?

My concern is that male testosterone naturally decreases around middle age and I certainly don't want to encourage it with my diet."
vegan,"Vegan food replacements (Impossible meat, vegan cheeses, etc) are presumably developed through having people taste them side-by-side with the animal product. How is that not the same as animal testing?","Vegans don't use things like shampoos that were developed through testing on animals - even though there is no ongoing suffering for animals, the suffering was necessary in the initial development of the product.

Naturally, meat and dairy replacements aren't developed in a vacuum. A vegan wouldn't be able to develop a replacement product and say ""Ah yes, this is what I remember meat being like 5 years ago"". You need an active meat-eater to taste the real and fake meat and say ""Yep, I think we got it just about right"". So you have to eat the real meat initially to develop the fake meat.

But how is that different from the shampoo initially being tested on a lab rat for safety, before being deployed out to the human market? How is deploying a previously-animal-tested shampoo different from deploying a previously-beef-compared fake meat?"
vegan,I watched Dominion...,"Lemme tell you, I (18F) have never been so disturbed or heartbroken by something in my entire LIFE.  I don't cry, ever.

I've been a strict vegetarian for almost 3 years but I decided to transition to vegan yesterday.  All animal products out the window.  I'm in the process of replacing all my skincare products with vegan ones.  

I'm just wondering why I never made this choice sooner and why so many people ignore the cries of the innocents."
vegan,Looking for advice on going vegan,"I’ve long wanted to go vegan and have tried to ease myself into it by doing a few vegan meals per week, then a vegan day, then multiple.

How did you transition into vegan?"
vegan,I don't notice anything of inflation :),"People who say ""veganism is expensive"" are stupid. It can easily be the cheapest diet lol. I don't know anyone who spends as little on groceries as I do.

Meat and dairy are expensive. Fruits, vegetables, beans, rice, bread, potatoes are usually the cheapest foods. And probably the healthiest too.

Yes, if you're going to buy **only** vegan meat, vegan cheese, vegan milk, then it may be expensive. But if you buy it occasionally, it probably won't hurt.

I'm glad that I can enjoy this benefit of veganism as well, apart from better health, less guilt, more love for animals and a lot more. Love it"
vegan,Really strange example of speciesism,"I just saw a tiktok where someone was making a song out of minecraft sound effects, pretty normal. One of the ways they got this sound effect was by dropping some animals from the game into the void. They dropped some sheep, some goats and some cats. And, of course, the comments were infested with 'Noooooo, Kitties!!!' 'Not the cats!!!!' and the like. Not a single person mentioned the sheep or goats. I guess their biases extend even to virtual animals that they've seen for two seconds. Carnists really do just only care about their precious cats and dogs."

vegan,My opinion on forcing vegan diets on dogs,"Before i begin,i want to say that i support all vegan activities and diets.

First off,i don't think that it is correct to force vegan diet on a dog,why?

1-Just by looking at their teeth,you can tell they're biologically predators,and ment to eat meat.

2-enforcing a vegan diest into them,is not healthy for them,neither is it natural.

3-i know that,by letting your dog eat meat,you are indeed letting animals die,but,have in mind,that forcing a vegan diet onto a dog will do your friend no good.5"
vegan,My trash can smells nice,"I became fully vegan 2 months ago, and while it has been challenging at times, I have noticed both subtle and not-so-subtle positive differences in my life. Just today, I was cooking a vegan stir fry, and as I was cleaning up, I took note of the fact that my trash can actually smelled pretty good. What once carried the uneaten parts of dead animals and outdated dairy products now held scraps of onions, peppers, carrots, and other fruits/vegetables. While Animal Rights and health benefits lie towards the top of the long list of reasons to go vegan, a nice-smelling trash can is certainly an added bonus!"

vegan,got spiked,"I've been vegan for a few years now and haven't really had many 'slip ups' because I don't eat out a lot. Anyway, on a rare occasion I ordered a falafel wrap and picked the ingredients so it would be vegan. Alas, they added dairy cheese.

When I discovered the cheese it was too late and I'd already tasted some. It tasted genuinely feral to me. Like sour and disgusting. It was shredded mozzarella and I recall enjoying this as a child. Now the taste is completely different to how I remember and even thinking about it makes me want to throw up.

Has anyone else experienced this?? I had no idea my taste buds had transformed so much but I'm not mad about it 😎 just another reason (to add to the millions of reasons) to NEVER to back EVER hahaha."
vegan,Should I compromise my morals for my job?,"I write for a newspaper and magazine owned by the newspaper. I'm also a vegan for moral reasons. Sometimes I have to write about restaurants, which makes me uncomfortable because they're never vegan. I put up with writing news stories about restaurants because at least they're news. But when it comes to the magazine, those stories are meant to glamorize things. It's a lifestyle magazine.

My boss asked me to write a magazine article about a restaurant, and I did. It didn't feel right. I sent him an email yesterday saying I refuse to write more magazine stories about restaurants, and I'm only willing to write news stories about restaurants if there's nothing better to write about. He said that won't work.

I like my job and career field. I don't want to leave either. But I don't want to support animal abuse by promoting restaurants that get their animal products from cruel factory farms. When I write those stories, I know that more people will support those restaurants as a result.

Should I just do what my boss wants? Should I get another job?"
vegan,Jurassic World Dominion a Vegan Film?,"Okay, so \*\*\*potential spoilers ahead\*\*\* but has anyone seen the new Jurassic World movie? The movie was pretty much awful/boring, but one bright side was it felt like this movie had major vegan/animal liberation themes. 

Like, not just the in using the name ""Dominion"" but the movie opens with three of the characters breaking into a breeding facility to rescue a baby dinosaur and the imagery really looked like it was pulled from a DxE documentary. It also felt like there were so many instances where the film actively tried to make viewers think about how humans view themselves as superior to other animals, and how our exercising of violence over them is rooted in this belief, and that it's not just cruel, but will ultimately lead to our own demise. 

There are like ten other examples in the movie that come to mind, all super subtle, so not sure if im reading into it/seeing my own beliefs reflected. idk, would love to hear others thoughts!"
vegan,I'm disgusted by everything and everyone now.,"Hello,  
I recently turned vegan. Three weeks ago, to be exact. I don't see animals as food anymore and I feel really fucking stupid for not having realized the horrors of the meat, dairy and milk (..etc.) industry sooner. I just discovered Earthling Ed on YouTube, watched one of his videos, then watched another ten and boom: I turned vegan overnight.  
Now my problem is that I feel disgusted by everything and everyone. I'm so glad my boyfriend went vegan right after me (he was being vegetarian his entire life before). But today I told some of my closest friends about having turned vegan and the first thing I got to hear was: ''Vegan? Veganism is a sickness. I get being vegetarian, but being vegan is clearly too much''. My other friends just relied on the chicken-nuggets-tho-argument.   
I'm also going to London in July to visit my grandma and during a facetime call I told her ''Hey I have to tell you something before you buy groceries for me and my boyfriend: we went vegan and we would very much like it if you didn't cook/buy anything non-vegan for us, we will take care of our food ourselves'' and she grabbed her head and said ''holy shit''.   
So my question is (or maybe it's just a late night rant): what do I do?  
I genuiely feel like never talking to my friends again, calling London off and just hiding in my room forever. I get it, I also used to say ''yeah I couldn't be vegan'', but I never claimed that veganism is a sickness. In fact, I always respected my boyfriend for being vegetarian and vegan people for being who they are and what impact they have. Hearing such a thing from one of my closest friends really broke my heart. I tried to counter every of their arguments properly and with facts (even offered them a source) but they would just decline and say stuff like ''I just don't like vegetables, that's all''.

Rant over, I think."
vegan,is this claim about beef production and deforestation true?,"i’m looking for figures on how many trees are cut down per pound of beef. the only prominent claim that i’m seeing is:

‘to produce 1 pound of beef, it takes approximately 55 square feet of rainforest, which is anywhere between 45 to 55 trees’

is this true? it just seems unbelievable to me. i know beef production is the leading cause of deforestation, though, so potentially it is? but as far as i can see, there aren’t any sources cited, and  all the claims are coming from vegan websites. 

vegan btw"

vegan,"I will be leaving Reddit for good now. Thank you, fellow vegans for inspiring me to come out of my shell and work towards being a better advocate and activist for the animals.","Hey guys. I've been here for some months and this was my first ever experience being a part of a vegan community online. Seeing the intense desire for change and to rid the world of injustice towards animals from you guys really helped solidify my fairly recently-sprouted desire to stop sitting back idly as a vegan and to start actively defending animals by becoming an activist. 

Thanks to you guys I now know this is how I must move forward and there's no going back now. I can't just sit and do nothing to help animals out of fear of ""offending"" people and ""starting arguments"". I know that no matter how much the truth hurts, and no matter how much they blame their feelings on me, people must be made aware of it. I regret the near 7 years I've spent as a vegan where I chose to keep everything inside and not speak out. Now that has changed. 

I liked having a lot of common ground with people here. I enjoyed the memes, the humor, all the posts, even just having people being able to see where I was coming from and share my views when I made venty/ranty posts.

But most importantly, it made me happy to see so many people wishing to rid the world of the most widespread, normalized and accepted, defended and even beloved cruelty of all.  

I have decided that I no longer want to be a Reddit user anymore after I have made numerous reports on posts detailing and showing horrible cruelty to animals as a fetish, as well as some sickening posts by a man who fantasized about raping his underage daughter and Reddit reviewed these reports multiple times and told me everything was okay and that nothing about any of this violated their terms of service. 

It has come to my attention that Reddit just does not care about such things, despite other users also trying to take them down, and I simply do not want to be a user of any application that endorses and allows this type of disgraceful behaviour. It does not sit right with me at all and I cannot feel comfortable using this platform anymore knowing the things they consider to be okay and permissible. 

I will delete all my posts and comments in some hours and scrub my presence from this platform, however, do screenshot or download any of my posts that you would like to save and use for activism purposes in any way. I have 2 good (but graphic) anti-dairy posts up here some of you might want for sharing, so I'll leave everything here for a little while so you can take them if you want them.

I will still be around on the Internet, with a YouTube and Instagram account of the same username you see here and I plan on making additional accounts too. I hope to do more and more for animals and also to one day produce my own music, so perhaps you'll come across me again one day.

Please. Keep doing what you are doing and don't ever stop. Please, keep spreading the word, fighting the good fight and encouraging others to join us.
Never stop doing what's right."

vegan,How do you feel about non-vegan second hand clothes?,"I have a 100% plant-based diet. However sometimes I buy - very sporadically since I try to be minimalistic and I basically have no money - non vegan second hand clothes. It is more than two years that I stopped buying non vegan brand new clothes (I do not buy brand new clothes in general, I only buy second hand), but I still feel guilty. Basically I feel as I am using shoes made by the skin of my dog. Sorry for the metaphor. It is awful (as it is carnism tho). How do you feel about that? 

Sorry for my poor english"
vegan,Thanks for not trying to outlaw eating animals.,"Unlike pro-lifers, you aren’t actively trying to make it illegal to eat meat or dairy. 

If you consider eating meat to be murder, which, to my understanding, you do, then I respect that opinion; I would consider the pro-life campaign to make abortions illegal equivalent to you trying to make eating meat illegal. 

I just want to say that I appreciate you not doing that."
vegan,Question about the ethics of heparin,"Hi! I was reading a textbook and it mentioned that heparin (a common anticoagulant) is made from purified pig intestine or cow lung. I was just curious how this fit with the vegan lifestyle. I’m personally not vegan, but I do try every day to be more ethical in my food and environmental consumption, so I wanted to know how ~real~ vegans felt about this. 

So I guess two main questions I’m wondering about: 
1) does the ethical code of veganism include medicine and procedures made from animals? 
2) if you needed an anticoagulant (assuming you are conscious and able to communicate) would you request an alternative medicine instead of heparin? 

Thank you for entertaining my question!"

Ideally, it would be derived from organic ingredients and have very limited additives.

I appreciate all tips you may have =)"
vegan,Do I have to stop being vegan?,"So, I'm very prone to calcium-oxalate kidney stones. Like, 2 years ago I had 10 of them at once. Painful stuff. I went vegan about a year ago and have been really enjoying myself, but now I have more stones and have learned that my main sources of protein (tofu, nuts, and legumes) are high in oxalates. I avoid spinach and rhubarb, but I'm not sure how I can keep my vegan diet if I can't eat tofu/soy products or nuts. 

I would really like to be able to stay vegan, if anyone has any tips on how to maintain a healthy, ethical lifestyle while avoiding oxalates as much as possible, I would greatly appreciate it. I've been reading vegan sources on it, but I'd rather hear from someone who is in the same situation and can offer diet or meal recommendations."

It jumped up and ran but I backed away quickly out of sight not wanting to scare it more. Now I can't find it' There are houses around and then woods, but the wooded area is at least 5-6 houses away. It's all wooded and rivers and little lakes and farmers fields beyond that. I told 2 neighbors but that's not much help. The neighbors with dogs bully me so I didn't go there and hope it doesn't go there. There is another tall wildflower garden on my yard, but I don't know if it would have stopped again so soon.

vegan,Trying to be vegan and dealing with food attached to feelings,"I’ve wanted to be a vegan for a long time, I tried it on and off through the years but now I want to be really committed to it. I’m not the type of person that likes the taste of meat anyway and I genuinely find vegan food delicious, so the part that is a struggle to me is planning ahead and knowing what to eat. These struggles I’m overcoming as time goes by and I learn, but there’s one I really don’t know what to do/how to get around it, and that is: my Mom’s food. I live with her and she LOVES cooking, we used to have pizza together every Saturday, she doesn’t have any friends or family here but me, so I’m the only person that used to eat her food. I’m a very skinny guy and she always complained that she wanted to cook more but I barely don’t eat anything, when I wasn’t living with her she just wouldn’t cook often anymore because she never does anything only for herself. I feel very guilty for declining her food, I know how she loves that and I don’t want her to think that I dislike what she does. She doesn’t know any vegan recipes but if I tell her she sometimes makes some, but she really doesn’t like them, even when she founds them good she still strongly prefers meat and it’s not a good substitution for her. What’s the best way to explain to her/decline her food? I hate to be the ‘annoying’ ‘anti-fun’ person, specially to her."
vegan,Shit like this brings the movement down,"Hi guys, I have a rather unpopular vegan opinion and I'd love to hear other people's feelings towards this topic. 

Bringing up the health detriments of eating animal products is useless and often has a negative impact on the movement. 

Far too often I read claims that ""meat causes cancer"" and ""dairy causes acne"" from people who have clearly never studied a science in their life - never mind a food related science. I don't think definite statements have any place in science and I also think those definite statements are so easily debunked by the plethora of articles claiming the health benefits of meat. There's the potential that veganism as a whole could be considered invalid if we keep allowing well intentioned vegan activists to talk about such a nuanced topic in such an amateur and frankly, embarrassing way. 

I just feel that the moral argument and environmental impact is more than enough of a reason to go vegan without delving into the often confusing and easy to debunk argument of health. ""A balanced whole food plant based diet is nutritionally adequate and often has some health benefits"" is more than enough. 

What are your thoughts on this?"
vegan,Anyone ever had a really positive interaction when explaining veganism?,"We've all heard the same handful of bullshit arguments, been laughed at, insulted. I've even nearly been assaulted.

What I've never heard is ""that's a really great point, I should look into that"" or ""oh shit, you're right"". I think I've seen one video where the dude just made the connection instantly and asked what he could do, it brought the activist to tears. Anyone have any stories?"
vegan,Veganism and Investing,"A question to all the vegans out here.
How do you approach investing in the stock market ?
Do you do you due diligence to ensure the companies have no unethical practices?
Do you invest in mutual funds, where one has little control in the companies we invest in ?
I've invested in mutual funds all these years and do deal with the guilt that my investments contribute to companies which exploit animals. 
Any alternative ethical solutions for long term wealth growth is also welcome."
vegan,Is exercise mandatory for vegans?,"I've been vegan for about a month and a half now, and I'm very happy with the decision!  So far, I've lost about 15 pounds so far.  However, I've also noticed that my stamina and strength has decreased too.  Now, I have no problem admitting that I'm not exactly ""in shape"", but now it seems to be worse.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, at my workplace, I often push around heavy containers full of T-Shirts for packing.  Usually I can push it fairly easily, but lately I've noticed that I'm putting more effort into pushing the same bins.  It's as if my strength has gone down.

&amp;#x200B;

Another example.  There's a park in the middle of my city with a huge hill in the middle that used to be a trash pile some 20 years ago.  While I was an omni, I could walk up the steps to the top of the hill and need a moment's rest when I got to the top.  However, this past Sunday I tried walking those same steps, but only made it about 3/4ths the way before I had to stop for a breather.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I be worried, or is this normal for a new vegan, the loss of strength and stamina?

&amp;#x200B;

Now, before you start beating your chests and tell me that being vegan isn't about the health, I already know that!  It's about stopping the suffering of animals.  But it is a side-benefit of being a vegan."
vegan,Struggling with euthanising my cat,"I have a 25 year old cat. Who I rescued when he was 7. In the last few years he’s lost his hearing, struggled with arthritis and dementia. About six months ago at a check up he was diagnosed with a tumour in his abdomen, and a heart murmur. The vet said he wasn’t in any pain and told us signs to look out for to know he is beginning to struggle. Those signs began a few days ago. 
I’ve booked a private home visit from a vet and nurse on Sunday to help him on the next stage of his journey. I know it’s the kind thing to do. I know he’s tired and he’s ready, but I am feeling immense guilt. It counteracts my lifetime commitment to never pay to harm animals or contribute to that. But I also know it’s cruel to keep him alive and in pain. I’m just reaching out in the hope anyone has had similar problems and concerns."
vegan,A vegan girl and a carnist boy,"Hello everyone!  
I have a relationship problem here.... I am F (28 yo) my bf is M (42 yo).

I met my bf 4 years ago. We both used to be omnivores.

Since 1 year I'm strictly vegan. I don't see myself going back EVER. 

My BF stayed omni, and he's a big meat eater.

I fell in love with him 4 years ago for many reasons, and I stayed in love with him for even more reasons.

But since I am vegan I have tried to discuss veganism/animal abuse/specism with him many times, and the answer I have gotten from him I can summarise in: ""I'm sorry for them (animals) but bacon tho"". He clearly told me he would never go vegan and that if there was a cruelty free meat substitute that tasted the same he would choose that over the ""real thing"", but if it costed more he would still choose the cruel meat over the plant-based substitute that tastes the same. In his scale of values it's money-taste-self pleasure over compassion and this is so against everything I'm fighting for (I'm also an activist).

I am also an environmentalist and he doesn't care about environment either.

He's very respectful and supporting of my choices (he makes sure everything is vegan for me, never made nasty comments about my choices and overall he's like ""Go girl! Go save the world while I'm eating a steak and drinking Cola from a plastic bottle"") but I can't respect his. I feel I am loosing esteem of him since my values now are clearly opposite of his. I don't want to give moral judgement but let's just say he behaves so much like everything I'm trying to fight with my battles.

Few months ago I didn't think this would be a problem but now it clearly is. 

What would you do in my situation? Is the relationship doomed?"
vegan,A poem..,"I wrote this toward the beginning of the year, in rehab, while struggling with alcoholism, prescription amphetamine abuse, and partially resultant existential despair, general hopelessness, and suicidal ideation. I began a habit of writing most of a poem while depressed and anxious, then finishing it when in better spirits (post exercise usually). Curious what people think.. but it's not that good. Will do my best to communicate the intended cadence..

""

They laugh about the chickens,

 about the cattle and the sow.

Pretend that they deserve them, 

and never raise a brow -

at how it'd feel to be born. in. hell..

tortured, scorned, and thought of less.

They boil, skin, and cut their throats, 

then gladly gobble up the mess. 

&amp;#x200B;

My heart aches for these beings, 

they don't deserve the life they get.

They think it's fine to kill them, 

and do so without regret. 

&amp;#x200B;

Gods made-up give them warrant

to contribute to this pain.

But even if the gods were are real,

I doubt they could explain. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, existence is destruction, 

my shoes do smash the grass.

But billions needn't die to sate these appetites en masse.

&amp;#x200B;

I try to tell those able, 

to share a chance to grow..

But so few ever listen,

they'd rather just not know. 

&amp;#x200B;

""I like meat too much, and cheese too much to ever change my life.""

""I think I'll stay stuck in my ways, turn blind eyes to the strife. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Their hearts enlarge, and arteries clog.

Their clouded minds stay stuck in charge,

and my adjacence to their zoo of ills 

makes me want to down these pills..

to leap right off of building's rooves, that were built by roofers wearing shoes, 

that were glued together by rendered hooves

of animals I. Could. Not. save. 

And so I seek an early grave. 

&amp;#x200B;

But if I die, who fights the fight?

It's not just me, others share my sight.

Even if it's just one soul,

saving them might make me whole.

The gift of life, of care and love,

the shift from hopeless cell to grove...

&amp;#x200B;

For them, I gladly heed the call.. This day, right now, I declare to all: I'll never jump with intent to fall.

vegan,Positive encounter with a public healthcare nutritionist,"So I decided to become vegan a few months ago and an omnivore aunt of mine recommended I see a nutritionist to confirm my nutrition was complete / healthy. I saw in her eyes that me not eating animal products was worry some while positively intriguing to her. She wasn't against it but when she studied nutrition in university 30 years ago it definitely wasn't recommended and she hadn't updated her knowledge since. Some of our discussions definitely where making her question her own beliefs.

As I am pretty confident in my nutrition knowledge and trust my diet to be extremely complete and healthy i dismissed the advice as not being required. Later I revised myself and decided to go see a nutritionist to be open minded, because I live in a socialized healthcare country and out of curiosity of what a state offered nutritionist would say.

So anyways 10ish days after enquiring I saw the nutritionnist today who said my vegan diet was the pretty much optimal. From her analysis of a few days of my nutrition as well as my blood tests I did before the appointment: I am getting plenty of all the necessary macro and micro nutrients and should just keep eating a variety of plants as I am doing.

She also sent me some government documents about eating a plant based diet: recommended portions, variety of stuff, some Q&amp;A, etc, like why not to eat honey or other products from animal abuse like wool.

All this to say I was positively surprised."

Makes 4 servings (\~500 calories)."
vegan,"Please be compassionate and not harsh: I am a caring and genuine vegan, but I struggle so badly not to kill bugs.","I’ve had extreme fears of centipedes, spiders, wood crickets, and other large bugs my whole life to the point that I can often hallucinate them in the corner of my eye because of how afraid of them I am. I cant really move them outside. Additionally, it’s so hard to break the habit of casually killing an ant or fruit fly that goes on my food, or slapping a mosquito that tries to bite me.

vegan,The Alkaline Vegan Diet: Clearing Misconceptions,"**CLEARING MISCONCEPTIONS**

**MYTH:** The alkaline diet and its supposed benefits are falsified due to its inability to change the body’s pH (Besides urine) based on research. 

**TRUTH:** While it makes absolute sense to assume that the agenda would be to change the body’s pH, what the diet actually is doing is removing the mucus and waste from the body that is the result of artificial, acidic foods and their byproducts circulating the body engaging the human’s innate defense mechanism. While human beings produce mucus to defend itself from any kind of intrusion or threat the human body is not designed to constantly fight against threats of this sort nor is it meant to because it will begin to treat the body itself as the threat since there are nothing but acidic byproducts in the body perpetuating this cycle. This, in turn, results in varying diseases that are consistent with whichever part of the body contains the mucus. When there is mucus in the bronchial tubes it’s bronchitis, when it is in the lungs it is pneumonia, when it is in the sinuses it is sinusitis and so on and so forth. While the mucus is meant to break down various levels of infection it is now attacking and slowly breaking down the organs in the human body from the inside out.

Although there are artificial foods that are alkaline it is not just the pH that is a concern, but also the artificial byproducts of the foods themselves. For example, and also in reference to the misconception, the blood may be considered alkaline with a resting pH of around 7.3-7.4 that is unchanged on the surface, but inside the blood may be an excess of uric acid, amino acids and other foundational acids that do not deliberately change the given pH of whatever they are a part of. This is why the body’s pH on the surface is relatively unchanged no matter what you eat, but needs naturally alkalizing foods in order to heal it. Once the body returns to its natural state and all of the toxins as well as mucus are removed from the organs in the body your body is cured and may then return to its natural lifestyle. This is an explanation of why those undergoing treatment by Sebi or his family are required to do a colon cleanse before completely detoxifying their body while also taking in the herbs that provide the body with natural iron and minerals to restore the intracellular health of whomever is being treated for their disease.

**MYTH:** The alkaline diet does not cure or aid disease and makes no difference according to “valid” research. 

**TRUTH:** For those In disbelief, one great example of how removing acidic foods from your diet can cure or save you trouble from a plethora of diseases is in the documented cases of **gout**. Once uric acid in the blood becomes extreme enough you run the risk of developing many different diseases or life threatening conditions such as stroke, heart attack, heart failure, and more while if you were to only digest alkaline foods the pH of your urine would begin to rise and eventually you’d stabilize the level of uric acid in the blood even in some very extreme conditions thus eventually curing and preventing further damage.

But others have told me that while they won't eat it for ethical reasons it still smells good to them.

and i 11000000% commend him for not wanting to waste food, i also hate food waste and try to avoid wasting food as much as possible but idk. i just wanted to reach out to the subreddit and see if maybe it would be a good idea to ask him if he could maybe give the foods to a friend who still eats animal byproducts. 

he did say this morning that he’s thinking of giving some frozen chicken to a friend. i just… idk. knowing he’s saying he understands why i’m vegan and that he now wants to as well but chowing down on turkey sandwiches without a care in the world almost is kind of bugging me.

They keep the chickens in a coop outside and allow them to come in. I think they are the domestic chickens that are raised on farms normally. Their chickens lay eggs of course, and since they don't have a rooster, the eggs aren't fertilized. Would it be okay if they ate the eggs from their pet chickens? My friend doesn't like social media, so I wanted to ask this for them. I figured this would be the best place to ask. My friend really likes eggs, so they don't want to give them up, which was the main reason they got eggs in the first place. They have had the chickens for around a year. My main question is would they still be vegan if they ate the eggs from their pet chickens? Thank you for any responses.

vegan,Why not save soil? The easy way to save the planet,"going vegan is certainly great for the environment ,but do you really think you can even convert 50% of the population to vegan with all these powerful industries?

do you think so? I don't, i can't even convert the person closest to me to my diet, and with the population multiplying itself in last 100 years, we are heading towards a large scale famine. when soil dies there is no food production.

 the basis and mother of all life, Soil.  I support save soil

When soil turns into sand it becomes a dessert, greenery is needed to support life, life thrives with greenery compare a rain forest to a desert. save soil is not against any industry, the world can be the same with animal agriculture but climate can still be reversed. For that, soil has to be rich, at least 3% to be considered alive. no nation has an average of 3%, meaning all of us are heading towards a famine. Africa has 0.3% by the way, it is basically dessert and famine inducing condition if at 0.3%.

rainforests have soil organic content at 70% or more. a place where life thrives.

I feel like the only vegan here sometimes, and while I know that's not true, it doesn't seem to be a growing movement here. :( I'm guessing it's due to Latin America &amp; New Mexican culture being more centered around traditional dishes, but I could be wrong. 

If you're a vegan Latina/Latino here in NM or elsewhere, speak up! I'd love to hear your story."
vegan,Frustrating,"So, a lot of times when I am eating my vegan meals, my dad will stare at me, smirk, and say something along the lines of ""...you're only doing that because (my friend's name) does."" Yes, it is true that I was initially inspired toward a vegan lifestyle by a friend I met in college who was the first (and still only, besides me) vegan person I had ever met in my life. Her reasons were really only centered around personal health and the environment, but as I started learning more and informing myself on factory farming etc. I decided to become vegan for the animals' sake as well as both of the aforementioned factors. Now, I am happy with my decision and lifestyle--I make sure to eat healthy, get my essential nutrients, and I also commit much of my time to working out and exercising. 

 It is just so frustrating that my father constantly tries to demean what I am doing and make it nothing but some huge joke. He eats fairly unhealthy and has a pretty much sedentary lifestyle (and uses every excuse in the book for why that will continue to be the case for him), so honestly I suspect he is jealous that I am committing myself to something that he is aware has many benefits for myself, my mental health, and the world in general. A couple weeks ago, when he was making one of his comments (they can get nastier than the one I mentioned early), I replied ""could you please not make fun of me like that? I feel that it is uncalled for."" He was fuming with anger, went on a rant about how I shouldn't be giving him 'lip' after he has done so much for me, and then proceeded not to talk to me for about 3 or 4 days. 

Look, I know there's no changing my dad at this point in his life. He is stubborn beyond belief, and can never accept responsibility for doing something wrong or hurting another person. Our history is very rocky; unrelated but even when I came out as gay to my parents as a 17-year old four or so years ago, he was very unsupportive, at one point took down all of the pictures of me around the house, referred to me as the f word, etc.---so this has obviously also had a substantial impact on our relationship. My mom has offered to him many times that he should go to therapy, but both of us know he will never do so. Does anyone have suggestions on how to deal with this situation, either in terms of being vegan and how to handle him or even in the bigger picture? The toxicity is something I do not want to put up with, but here's the thing; I have a very small family, both of my parents have cancer, and I have a great relationship with my mom. Thus, I wanna do what I reasonably can to somehow make this family work. Thanks to anyone that has any advice!"
vegan,"Healthy Vegan Resources for my boyfriend who likes fast food, soda, and has high cholesterol?","I love my boyfriend, though I can't continue to be with him until he takes an active role in getting healthier, since it is stressing me out beyond what is good for me.  I'm hoping some of you could lead me to resources (i.e. youtube channels, books, videos, etc.) that can help him cook vegan healthy / buy vegan fast food (baby steps for him to become healthier), so he no longer has to take cholesterol meds and is sugar and iodized salt addicted."
vegan,a thought for my fellow vegan vet techs out there,"Lately ive been thinking about the intersection of our jobs with our ethics. Vet techs are notoriously underpaid, overworked, and looked down upon or in general not met with respect deserving of the work we do. Our skills and knowledge are seen as lesser compared to human nurses and I think it's because we work with ~just~ animals - who are seen as lesser. 

But in a society where animals are routinely tortured and killed for food, of course they're seen as lesser. So the real solution to the problem of our lack of respect is widespread vegan ethics. Of course its hard as fuck to bring this up in vet tech circles because the cognitive dissonance is astounding and resounding.

I know this is a bit of a stream of consciousness but Im just curious what my fellow vegan vet med folks think."
vegan,Why is animal cosmetic testing still a thing?,"I can’t wrap my head around it. For one, why does my deodorant and toothpaste and shampoo and soap need to be tested on an unwilling animal? I feel like there are plenty of humans willing to test stuff at this point right? And if they aren’t, what does that say about the product? I feel like at this point, a lot of ingredients used in the things mentioned before have been used for years and years. Just let people sign up for trials who want to try a new shampoo. They aren’t making leaps and bounds in the scientific world of body was right? Unless I’m just being completely dense I don’t know why animal testing is still allowed. The EPA says they’ll phase out all animal testing by 2035 but do companies really need 16 years (was announced in 2019) to phase this out? Might seem like I’m rambling but I truly can’t understand why this is still a thing."

vegan,Any autistic people in here willing to help?,"I want to help my girlfriend become vegan, but I'm not sure how to do it.  There are 2 major hurdles.

Second, she's autistic.  And with that mindset, she's very much unwilling to break her routine unless she's forced to, or she wants to.  I'm not sure exactly how to persuade her that veganism is the right path for her.  She only eats at a handful of restaurants, and only orders the same meal every time.  And if I suggest something different, her typical response is ""Thanks for the offer, but I don't want to.""  She says she's interested in going vegan, but every time an opportunity comes up, she chooses the omnivore path, especially if that path involves chocolate.

vegan,Genuine Questions: Why don't you eat eggs?,"I have a vegetarian friend who won't eat eggs because they wanted all eggs to be hatched into more chickens? Questionable reasoning aside I'm just wondering why vegans don't eat eggs for reasons other than plain taste preference. Ethically there isn't anything wrong with eating eggs (sustainably sourced ones obviously, I have done my research on the poultry and meat industry). 

I have a pet chicken as spoiled and loved as a chicken can be (who will never be eaten) and I feel that not eating her eggs would be a disservice because 1. She lays them everyday so it would waste food, and 2. If I don't eat them she will and I just find that a little odd. 

So genuinely, why don't you eat ethically sourced eggs?"
vegan,AITA for setting rules of no non-vegan food in my house?,"&amp;#x200B;

Hi fellow vegans! I've been vegan since September of last year, just for background...

So, I've started dating post divorce (not vegan related, but the fallout oddly did play a part in my going vegan), and I've met someone through an atheist non-profit I'm a part of (so we are in agreement on that, to start). She is, however, not a vegan. 

We've talked about why I'm a vegan, and I appreciate that she is interested in the logical reasons why I'm vegan, and she seems to understand and shows agreement with my reasons, but isn't ready to try being vegan, at least as of now.

Tonight we went out again, and she is great company. She's smart, fun, and we agree on most everything outside of veganism. However, tonight we had a discussion when I said that I recently decided that I was going to set the rule that in my house non-vegan food is not welcome. As in, if I were to host a gathering (which I like doing), I expect all guests to respect the fact that all food at said gathering is to be vegan. She found that to be something that she didn't agree with, she felt that it was exclusive to others. I suppose that it is exclusive, but the idea of meat or animal products is something that I cannot stomach anymore.

I tried to give her the example of if she were to go to a Muslim household, she wouldn't expect pork to be welcome if she brought it, and the example of if a friend were to come over for dinner and demand that a prayer to be said (she's an atheist, as I said before), that it wouldn't be reasonable for guest to expect that. However, she still didn't seem fully accepting of my stance. I expect that it's the same defense mechanism that I would have used prior to going vegan, basically trying to defend her friends who love eating meat and aren't likely to question that desire. However, I left feeling like I made an ass of myself. I'm still new to dating, and probably ranted a bit too much...

I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but does anyone see it as too pushy for me to set the rule that in my house, only non-vegan food is acceptable?

She's great and compatible for me in every other way, and she wants to sit and watch some vegan documentaries with me next week, so also open to suggestions on that front! I'm hoping that if she's able to connect with the emotional power that I feel when I realized what animals go through for our pleasure, that she might start to understand why meat/animal products in my house is an issue for me.

Thanks!"
vegan,"There's absolutely nothing concerning about slaughterhouse work and eating meat, nothing at all :)","Katherine Knight was a slaughterhouse worker who decapitated and ate her partner, John Price. Here are some excerpts.   
*Price's autopsy revealed that he had been stabbed at least 37 times, in both the front and back of his body with many of the wounds extending into vital organs. Several hours after Price had died, Knight skinned him and hung the skin from a meat hook on the architrave of a door to the lounge room.*

*She then decapitated him and cooked parts of his body, serving up the meat with baked potato, pumpkin, zucchini, cabbage, yellow squash and gravy in two settings at the dinner table, along with notes beside each plate, each having the name of one of Price's children on it; she was preparing to serve his body parts to his children.*

*At 16 she joined her father, twin sister Joy and brother Charlie boning out carcasses at the Aberdeen abattoir. In the predominately male domain, Katherine became as tough as the best of them and gave as much as she got in the boning-floor jargon that would make a wharfie blush. She was renowned for not taking a backward step and with her knife in hand she'd challenge anyone who offended her to armed combat to abruptly sort the matter out. No one ever took her on. Katherine's proudest possession was her set of razor sharp boning knives which she kept in pride of place above her bed so she could have one last look at them at night before nodding off to sleep, no doubt to dream about killing animals and carving up their remains.*

vegan,Why not eat things that were tested on animals?,"I made a similar post to this with poor wording earlier, so sorry if this is a repeat.

A few months ago I decided to make the transition from vegetarian to vegan (after actually researching and not just going off of “animals dying is bad”), only to find out that I was not vegan but plant-based.  This was because I eat things that involved animal testing in their creation, such as Sucralose and JUST egg (mung bean protein).  While the testing on animals should never have occurred in the first place, why not eat those things now?  The testing is over, and no more animals are being harmed by it, right?  (Please correct me if I’m wrong, I don’t know a lot about this subject). Anyway, my question is why not eat food that was created/brought about via animal testing?"

vegan,Fiber Friendly Vegan Meals for Non-Vegans?,"Heya,

Some friends are going to be going on a few day road trip with me in the middle of nowhere and they suggested we pre-cook and pack some vegan meals into a fridge so that we can all eat the same food. 

In the past, I have noticed that Non-Vegans aren't usually used to the fiber intake of beans and lentils, and this can cause some stomach upsets. Even I had a few stomach upsets in my first couple of weeks going vegan before my body adjusted. As such, I'm trying to think of some meals that would be gentle on a Non-Vegans stomach and easy enough to cook up and put in a fridge for a road trip. The only meal that I can think of at the moment would be something like a mushroom risotto. Not too high in fiber, filling, tasty, and easy to pre-cook and take. Does anyone have any suggestions? I think this is also a good opportunity to show Non-Vegans that vegan food can be yumbo."

vegan,Summer Internship is inviting us to come do a tour of their meat plant. This is Sick.,"I got a summer internship with a grocery company working with computers and not in the actual grocery part of it. They scheduled an event for us to come tour their meat plant operations. They seem to imply that it's mandatory and say that if we are unable to make it that they will try to reschedule us for another time. 

Like seriously? It's not enough that they do that to animals and profit off of their torture and suffering but you have to brag about it too? What's really annoying about it is that on opening week they provided food and asked us to fill out a dietary restriction card. I was surprised and delighted that vegan was an option. I checked the vegan box but it didn't seem to matter because there were virtually no vegan options. 100% catered to carnists. 

What annoys me the most is that carnists seem to want to believe that vegans don't exist, and if they do believe they exist, they think that they are so few in number and not worth accommodating for. I am sure the tour guides will put on smiling faces and tell us how ""ethical"" their practices are. No way in Hell I'm stepping foot in that evil place."

Pet regulation is pure ass as well, with many pets not being properly taken care of since anyone can just buy a pet and have no one check up on them, and they're at the mercy of incompetent and abusive owners. As much as people like to portray human beings as  the most oppressed, they will just never compare to the atrocities animals have to go through. The suffering we experience just can't  compare to their suffering.

vegan,Religious argument for veganism (believing in ROE is to believe in God) Feel free to use,"this is an email i wrote to my dad, feel free to use it, i was pretty proud of it

&amp;#x200B;

Most animals lack abstract complex imagination. That is to say, they lack the ability to perceive how others feel on more than a shallow level. That is to say, they lack the ability to feel empathy. They moreover understand internal stimuli over external abstract concepts not immediately present to the senses.

This is why when they are hungry, they eat other living beings without remorse. Because lacking imagination means many animals are incapable of empathy.

However, humans have imagination and therefore can experience empathy. Do you think because animals are incapable of empathy, we should ignore our own empathy and not use it? To ignore its countless benefits? To ignore all the ways it has raised humanity out of the cesspit of cruelty in nature? To use it only for certain situations, and not all? Even though it so clearly is always the most beneficial thing for the self to do?

This is the basis of ROE. The belief that empathy is of paramount importance and that decisions that hold empathy of paramount importance will always result in the most fulfilling results for the physical needs and mental spirit of the self and others. Even when you are facing a situation with another being that does not possess the ability to perceive empathy (excluding situations that NECESSITATE self defense, as god explicitly states to only give up on this virtue when the self becomes jeopardized.)

note that this is only said of self DEFENSE, as in defending yourself from someone victimizing you to fulfill their needs or wishes, NOT self serving, as in victimizing others to fill your needs or wishes. God only wants us to serve the self if it can be done so without harming others. In all cases in the bible god directly advocates for people to allow themselves to die or even to kill themselves to avoid suffering, because the only option left to survive is to harm another and he doesnt want them to do that. god states that survival under those conditions will not bring godly fulfillment and therefore should not be sought, and instead you should trust in god and embrace death, joining him in the afterlife with a fulfilled soul unsullied by unfulfilling deeds. there are cases of this all throughout the bible and thats why i believe god would literally never advocate eating meat. i think he would rather us die if we had absolutely no choice like in every other case, and i think thats the obvious reason why he made us capable of making a choice and why i believe veganism is not only viable but equally viable to us as meat.   


I believe the results of ROE is quite literally the proof of Gods existence if not the presence of God on earth himself.

Believing in ROE is to believe that ""love thy enemy"" is beneficial to all and not foolishness.   


Believing in ROE is to believe that morality and virtue are beneficial to all and not meaningless self denial.  


Believing in ROE is to believe that the difference between us and animals that led to us obtaining dominion is something thats imperative we use to treat animals *purely* with empathy and selflessness, not subjugation and self serving or a combination of both.

This is why I believe that believing in ROE, and believing ROE imperatives veganism, is to believe in God."
vegan,The relationship between anti-blackness and anti-animal. Everyone here should read Aphro-ism,"Just finished reading [""Aphro-ism"" by Aph and Syl Ko](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35163604-aphro-ism) and wow I feel like I can see the world in an entirely new dimension.

The core of the book is how the framework of the human - animal binary and the white - black binary (both of which are white euro-centric frameworks) are related to each other and held up by white supremacy. The book argues how both binaries are the same and they need to be dismantled in order to accomplish liberation for everyone. Has anyone else read this?

However, I'm aware of how harming the dairy industry can be for the animals, and I know it's not fair to eat fish either especially considering the environmental effects of it, and I'd really like to try going vegan. The problem is, my parents won't allow me to go vegan because they don't want me to be unhealthy, and since I live with them I don't really have a choice. What I mean by this is I have ARFID(Autism induced), and I eat barely any foods. For reference, I eat:
Any white fish
Potato products(Chips, roast potatoes etc.)
Pasta on its own or with cheese
Chocolate
Sweets
Green apples
Any bread product
Popcorn
Broccoli

And that's it. My parents will only let me go vegan if I can prove that I can have a sustainable diet-I barely have one now, but I physically can't eat any new foods, as I regurgitate them. I have tried substitutes and I notice immediately and have occasionally vomited because of them. I'm not exactly sure what advice could be given, but if anyone has any I'd really appreciate it! Maybe some really realistic substitutes, or if anyone else has this same problem?

vegan,"I went vegan, and i didn't even notice. I need help for some tips!","Hello everyone, about four months ago, almost without wanting to, I became a vegan.   
I think I'm quite an emotional person, I didn't follow any guides or dramatic videos, it just seemed like the right choice to make to improve my life and my conscience. I got to 30yo, and my wife supported me a lot without even asking questions, or asking me why.

But now I'm experiencing the first ""problems"", if we can call them that.

I live on an island in Italy, Sardinia precisely.

Forget a comparison with Milan, Rome, in short, the big cities.   
I live in a very small town of 4000 people, and finding the ""ready"" products becomes really difficult.

This certainly did not stop me, luckily as a good Italian I love to cook, and I simply prepared everything I needed with basic raw materials. My wife (who is better at cooking than me), not even 15 days later followed me in this change, and it helped a lot.

Fortunately, thanks to the Mediterranean diet that we used to do before, legumes, carbohydrates, vegetables and greens have never been lacking on our table, but since we eliminated meat and derivatives we have discovered many new good things.

Damn, I had to ask a question instead I ended up writing a page, sorry, I get to the point, Now that I'm part of this subreddit, every day I see recipes, product reviews, above all ""ready"" bases, which intrigue me a lot, put something in a pan or in the oven, it is certainly more comfortable than preparing everything from scratch, especially in the summer when the work here increases and the time to devote in the kitchen is limited.

I ask the Vegans present here who are part of Italy or Europe (Of course also to the rest of the world if you know something!), if you have any knowledge of online stores, where to find ""ready"" products, which are however of quality and above all safe.

Vegan meat, Tofu, Seitan, Meatballs, alternatives to cold cuts etc.

It would really help me.  


Thanks so much for any help!

vegan,"I have a few questions about the Agricultural, &amp; Industry Aspects of Global Veganism. (For the Road Ahead with an Unlimited Budget)","My main observation is regarding the Objective Of, uniform Veganization. So my curiosity is what are the Perceived Limitations or Constraints revolving around vegan Food production itself?

I’m considering for example, the Unlimited Budget Approach to veganization. Okay so, if we are transitioning into higher yielding vegetable sources. How much additional land, if any, is necessary, If say the United States shifts to a vegan meal commitment overnight?

Are there specific climates that focus on specific produce? Ie. specific states that require land purchases for crops over others. What are those states mainly?

The second Observation I’m gathering is Food recipe research itself, &amp; manufacturing, the variety Approach to refilling the grocery outlets.

How much additional food manufacturing is necessary? Again if we use the United States as a pilot Vegan country. If we’re aiming for an overnight transition. We’re talking 300 million + additional vegan mouths to feed a day. What kind of manufacturing industry will be required here, I see the fundamentals widely in use here, whole food vegetable sources, Yet when I look at Fast Food &amp; restaurant variety’s, I’m gathering that recipe research is the main obstacle to reorient the menu’s item by item volume, correct?

For Example, I’m seeing a future shelf by shelf restock approach in the works for grocery outlets. That seems like a somewhat daunting task, yet do we have any ideas what % of the grocery outlets today are considered non-Vegan? So that we can put a % of new vegan items on an itinerary list, Volume of new items, to replace the shelves that are likely going to be replaced.

Again, I’m using the Unlimited Budget approach to Vegan Theory. So if I have Every Billionaire ready to throw money at the vegan market goal with no reserve Today. What are my options? Because that’s about what we’re ready to do here. So if America is Vegan pilot country #1. What other synergies can we gather here as we’re moving from country #2, #3, etc. eg. who will be leading the exports/imports?

Thank you for your Ideas &amp; advice

Peace, Love, Respect

The lowest I can go for a 35F degree is 1.16 kg (Nemo Forte) and for a 20F degree is 1.5 kg (Nemo Forte). Apart from the weight, the synthetic sleeping bags seem very large when fully compressed, which is actually my biggest issue atm.

It was suggested to me that I “just get a down” since it’s a once in a lifetime purchase, but I don’t want to get a support the down industry. So I’m wondering how any of you vegan backpackers have handled this?"
vegan,success!,"halfway through year two, and I have finally reached a point thats comfortable-- I consistently am living up to my own morals. No relapses, no backsliding, no justifying. It's second nature. Even when no one's looking, even when it's inconvenient, 100% plant based intake. I can say with certainty now that I am morally and ethically stronger now than I was when I first adopted a vegan ethic.

Relieved. Proud of myself. Feel great.

If it isn't happening for you overnight, don't worry. Don't give up. Don't believe that it's impossible for you. You got this. Anyone who pretends that deconverting from a lifetime of indoctrination can happen and be over in a day is doing harm to the journey that it takes. 

Keep at it 💪🐷💪"

vegan,Cognitive dissonance website - can someone help build it?,"I want to make a single-page website at a cute sounding domain. Like awwbabyanimals.com or something.


The page is visually divided into two sections:

1. The left side is a feed of cute Instagram/Tictok videos of pigs, cows, chickens, lambs, etc. Big bold text at the top of the feed is a counter that is increasing in real time - “1,663,382,382 likes of cute baby animals this year”. A secondary line of text shares w fun fact that cycles with each video - “pigs are emotional and smart, aww!”

2. The right side is a feed of the vile and abhorrent videos and images of slaughterhouses, the reality that people ignore or block out of their minds while they eat those same cute baby animals. Big bold text at the top is a counter increasing in real time - “1,638,262,372 animals slaughtered this year”. A secondary line of text shares the average age of slaughter for each animal species depending on what they are being slaughtered for.

I am a designer and can design this but I don’t know how to get these stats or communicate with an API to get a feed of videos. Can anyone help? I really just want to have a link that clear-as-day forces people to confront how fucking disturbing and evil this all is."
vegan,Should there be a horror movie focused on animal slaughter to promote animal rights?,"I know this sounds cheesy but in the hands of good screenwriters and directors this could be a genuine idea. It's something I had in my head a long time ago during my early vegan days. The premise would be simple, the POV would be a cow/pig raised on a farm or in the wild but they are suddenly captured/contained and taken to slaughter along with many others. Either that or perhaps it will start in a factory farm and we get a look at parts of it like gestation crates, gas chambers, slaughter floors ect. I'm not entirely sure how the plot would be structured in a compelling way though cause the concept is very direct but I think there would be some kind of device that allows the character to escape or postpone death, just for the sake of story but since it's a horror/thriller/drama they'd inevitably be killed. I would like to know what you think of this and how successful or well executed it would be, of course I don't have a cover to cover synopsis for it. I suppose you're thinking well people might as well watch Dominion or Earthlings but since they're documentaries they won't get as much attention as a cinematic or TV show especially depending on how well written and executed it is, and it of course will show us the suffering from the perspective of the animal by hearing their thoughts or narration and showing actual common slaughter practices. A particular plot aspect I'm imagining is that the animal character is close friends with a human, maybe a farmer/rancher or his family for years and conveniently they're either the ones who kill them or their friends, or send them to slaughter, which will reflect on the ""We love animals so much we make sure to kill them humanely and use every part"" BS. That's all I've got for it, I'd like to know what you think."
vegan,Someone I’m seeing gave me meat and thought it was funny.,"I started seeing this new person and we talked about vegetarianism/veganism and stuff , he doesn’t get it and think animals are made for humans to eat them and that’s nature . I stopped arguing and told him let’s agree to disagree. 

He mentioned few times how he wants to eat at non vegan restaurants with me and if I can ever eat meat and my answer is always no. 
That being said he buys me vegan food , is interested in cooking vegan food with me without me requesting it first. 

The problem is I thought everything was ok until few days ago, he bought me vegan wings and got himself non vegan. I kept asking if the one he bought was vegan because the packaging looks different (I just wanted to know so I don’t eat it myself ) and he kept saying is vegan , he plays stupid jokes sometimes so I thought he was lying but then thought maybe they added more options and it’s vegan , so I eat it . I didn’t swallow it even thou it tasted vegan to me I just had a feeling it waning. Then I asked this isn’t vegan and he was admitted it wasn’t and that he was gonna tell me not to eat it and was playing , but he saw when I tried to eat it and didn’t stop me. 

I told him how this was unacceptable and that he already knows I’m not ok with meat , he needs to apologize and never do this with me ever again. 

Usually this is like cut this person kind of  moment for me but for some reason I justified it him being childish and thinking this is a joke and not actually wanting to disrespect me. He apologised and we moved on but now it’s kinda hunting me. Should I have just cut him off at that moment ? Or was it ok to say if u ever do this again I will not be in your life , knowing this time he was trying to joke about something that’s not funny and not intentionally hurt me."
vegan,Curious which of the following you would perceive as worse,"I am not a vegan, but I spend time on the forum learning about veganism  because I have two friends who are vegan. I am curious as to how these different perspectives are perceived by folks who are, and which one of the following would be perceived less favorably. 

I've already asked my friends and have those responses.

Person 1: I do not care about animals and so I eat them.

Person 2: I care about animals, but I still eat them. 

Person 3: I care about some animals but not others. I eat the animals that I don't care about. 

Person 4: I care about all animals, I used to not eat them but have started to eat them again. 

Genuinely curious which of these four do you consider the worst. I wonder about this  because cognitive dissonance and contradiction seem to be recurring themes on this forum (and when I go out with my friends to dinner) to discuss non vegans. 

I read the rules for the form and I'm not sure if this qualifies as extensive debate or non-vegan, if it does feel free to close it down."
vegan,Share some music about animal liberation and veganism!,"A few years ago I heard a song with a feature by Analise D'Ambrosio, a singer from San Francisco. I suddenly decided to check out her own catalogue and found [this track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYj44bQuzgk) about animal liberation and was very pleased. It's not particularly overt in the lyrics and can easily be generalized to many forms of oppression, but the video makes it clear what kind of oppression she had in mind when writing it.  


Are there any songs or artists you all have found that promote animal liberation, whether or not the message is subtle?"
vegan,Hypothetical question,"So basically according to veganism killing animals is murder and eating the resulting meat is wrong.  Hypothetically speaking, would preferring steak over chicken be morally superior?  I get it both are supposedly wrong but beef has a way higher ratio of food provided to animals killed then chicken or something like shrimp.  Therefore, it seems eating steak would be of far less moral concern than eating chicken, because you only have to kill like 2 cows for a year of steak, the numbers closed to 40 or so for chicken, and probably a few thousand shrimp.  It would be like comparing a small time murderer to hitler, obviously hitler was worse.  Im actually curious what vegans think about this."

vegan,New to veganism (I guess you could say a plant-based way of eating; I am not vegan aside from food)? I have Q's?,"Hello, vegan community. 

Right off the bat, I want to say I love eating plant-based. When I do my own personal groceries, I make sure it's plant-based; I seriously do not take shortcuts. When I tried going plant-based before, admittedly, even if something contained gelatin, I brushed it off. Now I really double-check labels, and make sure when I'm putting in my body is vegan. 

That being said, how much do you value food products that say ""may be processed in a facility mixed with milk"" or akin to that. For example, Aunt Jemima pancake mix (I believe it's the original, and the main ingredient is basically white flour. When I was ready to buy a pancake mix that proclaimed to be 100% vegan (not processed in a facility mixed with other allergens like milk), it was nearly double the price. I'm all about following through with something, but to pay double the price for pancake mix? I don't have the budget for that-- I'm sorry. 

Also, what do you guys do at social-gatherings where vegetarian options are as ""vegan"" as it gets? For example, the restaurant my sister took my mom to had one vegetarian option: a falafel with tzatziki sauce. Of course, you could eat the falafel pita without tzatziki, but they did not have hummus as a side, and nothing else really ""pairs"" with falafel like tahini, hot sauce, or some sort of yogurt sauce (I do wanna try Kite Hill's tzatziki!). 

Now, this isn't me trying to cut corners with vegan food. If grocery stores were 100% vegan, that would make my life a thousand times easier. If all my family and friends were vegan, no problems at all. 

Am I a bad vegan for being vegetarian when the other vegan options are like... a bag of fries? I have to eat and take care of myself, too. Factory-farming is horrible, and, given the option, I will always pick the vegan option, but I also don't want to sacrifice my sanity and appetite in the process. Any thoughts? You can be honest. Maybe I do have to do better. But I certainly do not want to give up. I want to eat as vegan as humanely (and practically) as possible."
vegan,Is it more or less vegan to eat food with animal products that would otherwise be thrown out?,"I've been vegan for about a year and have always been extremely continence about living in a way that procures as little waste as possible. However I live with my family that is not vegan nor do they care that much about waste. Waste bothers them, but not enough to stop them from throwing away full trays of food. They give away what they can but there's a lot that just isn't acceptable to give away, such as food that has been reheated several times and dishes that many people have picked through. 

My question is, would it be more or less vegan to eat the food to prevent it from being thrown into the trash? Since I have have no qualms about eating what would be otherwise disqualifying factors for others, a part of me wants to eat the scraps so the creatures and their products don't get thrown to waste. 

Any insight would be much appreciated. I've been sitting on this line of thinking for a while. It really hurts me to see viable dishes with chicken and cheese to be discarded when they're still able to be eaten. Then the creatures really will have died for nothing if not to sustain another."
vegan,Oat milk starting to taste like plastic to me(???),"I used to love the Silk brand of oat milk, but then it started tasting kind of like plastic to me. Then got Oatly because we use it at work and I like it, but at home I swear it still tastes like plastic. So then I got the Califa one because a coffee shop I like uses it, and it mf tastes like plastic. I’m gonna scream. 
Every time I get oat milk from coffee shops it tastes normal, but store bought it tastes like plastic even right after opening it. :P … does anyone else have this problem? Or am I crazy"
vegan,Family gatherings with non- vegan’s,"There are 3 out of 20 vegans in our immediate family. When we all get together for holidays or birthday parties, there’s always both vegan and non vegan food/ snacks.

We bring enough for just us and if they actually wanted to try it they could but I know they just want to be greedy. Same goes for pastries and candy. ( y’all knw how expensive whole food vegan pastries and sweeties are) they want to eat their non vegan pastries AND ours. We get called ‘mean’ and made fun of because we ‘won’t share’ but what the heck!

vegan,Girl doesn’t want to date me because I’m vegan…,"For context I’m 20M and she is 19F.

I spoke to her for a week and she wanted to date me, I said that although it’s quite a big thing to mention, I only would like to date someone who’d consider going vegan or is a vegan already.

She then proceeded to tell me that she thinks it’s good to reduce meat consumption for environment etc… (even though she eats it regularly), but that she sees no issues with “unnecessarily killing animals for our consumption”, apparently because we can choose to treat animals how we like smh

vegan,I need help,I live in a household where being vegan is very hard. I’m a teenager but I cook food for myself and don’t really eat as a family so cooking fast food is easier for me. (corn dogs Ramen popcorn etc.) Recently meat and dairy have been making me feel sick and I haven’t really wanted to eat it but it’s all around me and all I can really eat. I bought beyond meat burgers and have been cooking those and I really like them and they make me feel a lot better and I have a lot more energy after eating them as opposed to a real burger. But it’s really hard to cook vegan meals around people who don’t want to eat vegan.

I googled with location services on, and it seems there are several businesses near me that rent out puppies for parties. 
*So cute!* I thought. *I love dogs, but I’ll probably never own one again. This seems like an easy way to spend time with them.*

But then I thought, *What is this business model? Where do the puppies come from, and where do they go when they’re not puppies anymore?*

I will likely stop growing soybeans to the greatest possible extent in the future.

If anybody has resources, or even has suggestions about where to start looking, that would be extremely helpful. Thank you!"
vegan,How do you determine whether a one food has had more suffering/ death associated with it over another?,"My dilemma with veganism is that how do you know that one food has had more death associated with it over another (since that's the whole point of veganism to reduce the amount of animals that died for your food?). What if SOME plant foods are worse than SOME animal foods? 

Assume:

1. One cup of rice causes 50 animal deaths (via pesticides, insecticides, cultivation, processing, transport etc)
2. One piece of grass fed steak (equivalent weight to cup of rice) causes 1 animal death/ steak. 

How do you calculate animal deaths and account for them when making food choices? Just because the death and suffering is indirect doesn't mean it doesn't happen right? Aren't some plant foods going to be worse than animal foods? Where and how do you draw the line? This is aside from accounting from the nutritional differences (ie you'd have to consume more than one cup of rice to gain a proportionate amount of nutrition from a steak). What is everyones thoughts?"

But I'm wondering if I'm kidding myself. If it'll only be appealing to like 3 people in the area, that's not something I can do. It's worth noting my area does get heavy tourist traffic in the summer, but I'm not sure if the extra revenue will be enough to last the winter. It would just be so nice to have a vegan cafe or restaurant in a local area out here so people wouldn't need to drive 50+ miles to the closest one. Any advice or ideas?

I am just curious. Sorry if it is offensive to you.)"
vegan,New vegan after being life-long meat eater,"Hi there! Long post alert!

I'm about to make the transition to veganism after being a life-long meat eater, and would like to find a space where I can ask questions and people will understand, as I'm pretty sure most of my family and friends won't.

I grew up in a household where the attitude was very much 'it's not a real meal unless it's got meat in it'. My dad thinks people who don't eat meat (especially men) are pathetic and 'gay'. My mum is also of the opinion that it doesn't matter because humans are more important than animals. I really internalised these kind of thoughts, and I'm ashamed to say I've eaten meat/fish with pretty much every lunch/evening meal I've ever had since I was a child.

I live in the UK, and in a similar way to most meat-eaters, I was labouring under the ridiculous impression that 'we have some of the beat welfare standards here' and I genuinely thought animals have access to the outdoors and led a peaceful life before a painless death. I thought eating meat/animal products was just a natural part of the circle of life, and all the other crap you'd expect a meat eater to say.

Anyway, at university I was quite heavily involved in a lot of liberal circles and I became really interested in activism, particularly around women's rights, LGBT+ rights, and income inequality. I was young, passionate, loud and angry about oppression and injustice. A lot of the people I knew were also vegan and of course at the time it did cross my mind to think 'makes sense people against oppression would also be against animal oppression' but unfortunately my other thoughts were louder and I kind of pushed it to the back of my mind. Like many meat eaters, I guess not confronting myself with the actual realities and uncomfortable truths kept me living as I did. I feel so ashamed of myself now, as I'm generally someone who does challenge my own thoughts and biases.

I'm 28 now, and I've spent the last couple of years thinking I need to cut my meat consumption for the good of the planet, but I've lacked the motivation and kind of adopted the stance 'the onus shouldn't be on individuals, it should be on corporations'.

Here's what changed: I've got a lot of mental health problems as a result of trauma, and for the past year I've been seeing a therapist. She's genuinely changed my life and I admire her as both a professional but also a human being. It was important to me we shared similar politics, and she is also an intersectional feminist. I wanted to take her some baking to say thank you, and she mentioned she was vegan. I briefly asked her why, and she gave me a couple of reasons but didn't go into too much detail because she's professional and I don't think she'd want it to impact our sessions. It got me thinking because she's someone whose opinion I really value, and it got me thinking about how little I knew about veganism.

I decided to go away and do my research, because I felt that as a meat eater, I should at least fully understand where my food comes from. Otherwise, how else could I possibly justify my choices and make an informed arguement? Anyway, over the past week, I've watched Dominion, Dairy is Scary, and Earthlings. I've researched and read about standard practice on farms. I've looked at all the statistics.

And I'm horrified. I've barely slept, and it's been on my mind constantly. I've read all the counter arguments against those documentaries, and I feel appalled. All the people saying 'it's cherry picked to show the worst parts' are blowing my mind. It doesn't even matter if those documentaries are showing the worst, it's enough that it exists. It would be enough for me if even one farm did that. And it's not only that- it's really made me question my own ethical position and morality. It's been more than enough to arrive at the conclusion that there is no ethical farming. There is no ethical, or moral way to eat animal products. Even the 'good' farms are bad. I don't want calves to be separated from their mums. I don't want male chicks to be macerated. I don't animals to be bred to the point where they have health problems. I don't want sentient beings to bred and eaten just for our pleasure. I don't want to exploit animals.

To me the only ethical conclusion is to become vegan. I feel so ashamed I've been so wrong for my entire life, but going forward I'll never buy another animal product again. I can't believe I've spent all these years talking about oppressive systems without standing up for the one group that literally has no voice. I will never support this vile system with my money again. I'll use what's left in my cupboards as I hate waste and also I can't really financially afford to throw out food/household products and replace them all, but I can't wait for them to be gone.

I thought I'd be worried about missing cheese and eggs or something, but surprisingly I really don't care. It feels like such a small price to pay to stop participating in cruelty. I love cooking, so I'm really excited to learn about a lot of new ingredients and recipes. I know I'll be able to make great food without animals having suffered for it.

Practically, I was wondering if anyone has advice about how to make the transition easily? For starters, I'm just going to eat my favourite meals e.g. chilli but make them vegan either by getting a vegan mince substitute or using black beans instead. If anyone has any recipes/cook book recommendations, that would be fab! What are some food cupboard staples I need? (I'm in the UK)

Also what household products do I need to look out for? I've had a look at them, but honestly most of the ingredients are chemicals. What sneaky things do I need to look out for that mean something isn't vegan friendly?

Also, please hit me with some good vegan chocolate recommendations (not dark as I don't like it!). That's probably the one thing I will miss the most!

Finally, could someone point me in the direction of resources for meal planning? I didn't eat particularly healthily before lol, but I'm getting married this year and might as well also use this as a way to become more healthy and actually give my body the nutrients it needs."
vegan,Since going vegan 1 week ago my resting heart rate has dropped!,"I went vegan a week ago today and my usual resting heart rate when I’m up and awake has been hovering between 78 - 85 and for the last few days my resting heart rate has been between 65 - 72. I’m blown away by this, do you guys think this is due to the amount of beans I’ve been eating?? For context my previous diet was very bad consisting of fast food and now I’ve been eating lots of fruit beans tofu rice with veggies ect."
vegan,How do you manage international travel while being vegan?,"I became vegan about 2 years ago. I found my rhythm and stuck to it, especially over the pandemic - I know the places to shop for awesome vegan ingredients, my favorite recipes, favorite vegan restaurants, etc. I even track every calorie and macro to gain weight/ muscle, which has been successful so far. However, I recently had to travel to Europe for 2 weeks and that threw a wrench in the works. Every 'vegan' option I was able to scout out at restaurants and local markets was unbalanced, heavy on carbs and light on protein, and pricey - mostly soups, salads, sugary protein bars, and sad attempts at floppy and spongey meat replacements. Needless to say, it was an unpleasant food experience and I lost a lot of weight. I'm trying to plan out my next adventure and I would love to hear from others that travel on strategies to make it work based on experience. Thanks in advance!"
vegan,Question ( this popped up in my head today),If a vegan has a furbaby  sheep or something else the produce fleece that has to be sheared what would they do with the fleece? Can they reuse it and make yarn from it and use it to make something for it or is it ok for them to sell the yarn or fleece? Where do vegan stand on this ? Or is this one of those thing that it depends on the person?
vegan,"I am legitamately burnt out and traumatized by helping and mourning ""roadkill."" Warning: NSFW","Today I was two hours late to work because I had to get emergency medical help for a tortoise whose underside was partially smashed, guts falling out, everything. It was really gross honestly but I FINALLY got him to a hospital (I really don't want to go into the story right here) and they believed they could save him and send him to the wildlife rehab in the area so thats good! I have a tortoise as a pet and I was pretty sure that they could stuff his organs back in and piece his shell together. I am relatively confident that his organs were intact and his bleeding was minimal. 


But I feel like the ONLY person who will even stop to assist a slow or injured animal off these back country roads. I am especially sensitive to turtles and tortoises since their first line of defense is just to hunker down (but that doesn't work with a pickup truck coming at them). 


I once witnessed a family of possums in various states of mutilation crying out and they were still alive but plastered to the road. It's just horrific. No one watches where they are going and don't think twice when they maim or kill some innocent creature just crossing the road. 


I feel insane but I see flashes of these animals sometimes because I am literally in there touching their bleeding bodies and scraping them off the road and it makes me sick. Nothing else seems to effect me like this. My drive to work went from incredibly pretty and relaxing (the first few days) to the most tense, high alert 30 minutes of my life.

vegan,"Please stop complaining to servers, workers, business owners, etc. that you don’t like impossible/beyond burgers","Started a vegan establishment about 2 years ago with my partner. I’ve been vegan over 10 years and he has been vegan over 20 years (just to give you an idea that we aren’t new to this). I can’t tell you how often people ask what the “burger” is made out of and when we tell them impossible or beyond (whichever we have in stock that week) they feel the need to tell us how much they hate it. How much they wish it could be a veggie patty or black bean patty. For some more context our entire menu is 100% vegan AND only vegans cooking your food. The burgers are just specials that we do and the rest of our menu is all stuff we make in house. We just have the burgers because so many people DO enjoy eating the impossibles or beyonds. These people could easily order ANYTHING on the menu that’s made from scratch. It’s a new thing I’ve noticed in the vegan community of people complaining about this. Like if you don’t like it that’s fine, you don’t need to tell everyone how much you hate it. You can just not order it. The energy behind this complaining is not helpful. It’s this weird shaming people for liking something that’s vegan, wth?? We have a lot of amazing people who come by and are grateful for us but I had no idea how many gatekeepers were out there until we started this business"
vegan,told by a carnist I abuse dogs because I trained my rescue,"P.S. The trainer was vegan, too. 

P.P.S. I fell like my post should be on AITA but i really only care about people who share my morals, you know? Some people might not understand. 

Tl;dr: animal killing and consuming ex(?) friend told me i abuse animals because I trained my dog with a trainer using a ""pop"" collar. Should I still be friends with her? 

An old time friend of mine recently told me that I abuse dogs because I trained my rescue in a training class for leashes. I had rescued him from an abusive house/farm many years ago and he hadn't ever been on a leash. I tried everything under the sun, from harnesses to putting him in a damn backpack (lol) because he always slipped out and ran into the nearest road to play ""catch me"". I eventually reconciled with the fact that he wasn't safe like this and decided to take him to a traning class. They taught everything you could imagine but I really was only interested in teaching him in a safe controlled area how to walk and stay on a leash (he learned some other tricks just by watching the other dogs... Man he was so smart! He passed of old age last year and is now in heaven with all the other innocent lives). He was SO smart that he kept outsmarting the trainer, BUT she was experienced and decided it would be best to train him with a ""pop"" collar until he learned some more and then go back to cloth collars. A pop collar, for those that don't know, is a loose, skinny, light weight chain that goes around the dogs neck like a collar and when they begin a behavior that is dangerous or ""bad"" you pull up lightly and quickly to make a slight popping sound on the chain. It never chokes the dog unless you are an abusive a-hole who does that on purpose. I obviously never did! We had a few sessions with the pop collar and then eventually he learned how to be safe walking near roads without it. He lived a happy, love filled life until he was 15 years old. He was a german shepard husky mix and the goodest dog to ever grace this earth. He saved lives literally and figuratively, he was simply the best and was safe the rest of his life because of his training. Eventually, he didn't even need a leash. 

In a groupchat recently, a friend asked what to do about her dog that had just slipped his collar and ran into the road, nearly getting hit by a car. I suggested a harness, a trainer, and told my story about pop collars. The friend in question, we will call her X, chimed in saying that pop collars are abusive and hurt dogs and choke and kill them. I expressed to X that I would never hurt my dog intentionally and always did my best to keep the chain loose to only allow ""popping"" noises, never getting tight enough to close around his neck. I detailed the way that the trainer taught me and expressed again that I would never do anything to hurt animals. X pressed again, claiming that I was encouraging dog abuse. I replied ""funny, i don't slaughter animals and display them on my plate only to consume the rotting flesh and let it decay in my intestines."" She then claimed I was being ""rude and mean"" and that I was ""so bad at communicating"". A little bit of an AITA moment here lol. The cognitive dissonance is strong with X, and idk if the relationship is salvageable. What do you think? 

I just don't think I will ever understand people who willingly kill and consume the flesh of innocent beings turning around and pointing the finger esp when X has a goldendoodle that she bought from a breeder. I just don't get it!"
vegan,Free Instacart Food,"I recently had an instacart delivery that was canceled on the way to the delivery, which means it's all mine to do with as I please. There's quite a bit of animal product in it. (4 steaks, a bag of frozen chicken breast, some cheese, and some frozen casseroles that I'm sure contain assorted animal products.) What would you do with this stuff?? 

I'm not concerned that it would be unhealthy to eat in general, and I don't think it's wrong to come into animal products on accident, but I just prefer my life of clear boundaries. It's easy. I'm not sure if I'll keep doing this side job now that I know it can saddle me with animal products, unless I can figure out what to do with them. But I have to figure out this order, regardless. 

I feel like the most obvious is to give it all to a carnist, but that feels like I'm sending the message that it's okay.

vegan,Argument with non-vegan friend,"I have this friend who I recently got into an argument with about veganism. He kept trying to say that my thoughts on veganism and how animals are treated are just an opinion. I was telling him about the reality and said he was uneducated on this. He took extreme offense to that and even tried to say ""I have other vegan friends and they wouldn't call me uneducated."" He had every basic non-vegan argument point. I am still very angry, but am I in the wrong to call him uneducated on the meat industry? I mean, to me, he is. We haven't spoken since and I don't know if this argument is worth losing a friendship over? I have been finding it very hard to have friendships with people that can't at least see that what happens to animals is wrong. Anyone have any thoughts?"

Damn me for the amount of cholula I had.

Damn it all.

Moral of the story is don’t believe your carnist brain when it says “ a little bit of cheese won’t hurt”. BULLSHIT

This is a huge part of why going vegan suits me. Because I feel like shit when I’m not. 

Every lapse is a new reinforcement to my ethical perspective. Do it for the animals, do it so you don’t spend a solid hour of your work days straining on the toilet."
vegan,Thank you for being you,"Hello people, I just wanted to thank all you that lead a vegan lifestyle as it takes a lot of courage to truly abide by such an uncommon way of life. Ever since I declared myself a vegan about 2 years ago, I have withdrawn ever so gracefully from society as veganism has pointed me into the direction of many other flaws of society such as racism and speciesism. As hardened and stoic of a man that I see myself, leading a life of veganism has presented it’s difficulties in my life, particularly socially. I am glad that I have found this group and I am not ashamed to confine in it as it gives me a sense of belonging in a carnist world. I don’t mean to be such a sap but thank you for reading this. ✊🏾🖤"
vegan,Anyone this think this clinical study on Mushrooms and its treatment against COVID has a chance?,"I'd love to believe it, but I dunno. Kinda hard to believe. Thoughts? (BTW, its Turkey Tail Mushroom they are testing).

Here is a quote from the study:

&gt;“Each dosing is thought to increase the level of cooperation between innate and adaptive cells that work together to recognize and seek out viral threats,” he explained in an interview. “We think the mushrooms increase the number of immunologic opportunities to better see and respond to a specific threat. In the doses used, the mushrooms perturb the immune system in a good way but fall far short of driving hyper or sustained inflammation.”

Anyone have any experience with Turkey tail?"
vegan,On Moral Offsetting activism,"Would this be a more effective style of effective altruism?

My goal is to eliminate factory farming. It is pure evil and cruel to the extreme.  Until factory farming is abolish, humanity as a whole really cannot be considered an ""ethical civilization"", but a civilization of a somewhat dark shade of grey. Studies have shown that people's knowledge of factory farming does not necessarily make the majority of them go vegan. This leads me to doubt the effectiveness of vegan only activism.

What if instead, we encourage them to donate money to cellular agriculture (lab grown meat) research? Or to foundations which advanced or try to maximize the good that comes out of cell ag.  In an earlier post you basically said the good does not wash out the bad. But isn't it better for someone who is complicit in factory farming to ALSO give $500/year to a credible foundation on lab grown meat/cell ag than it is for them to be complicit and NOT do anything to stop factory farming?

Vegan activism has it's limits. There is no large community with more than single digit percentage of vegans.

I'm going to be real clear here: A donor who donates millions to lab grown meat research, but who still knowingly consumes factory farmed meat is doing more for animal rights than the average vegan from an objective point of view. The good they do outweighs the harm they do by orders of magnitude.

Veganism will not make more than a minor dent in factory farming. A safe, and ethical alternative to torture-meat will."
vegan,I have been pescatarian for ~10 months and now am going vegan.,Last year around August I became pescatarian for environmental reasons and health reasons.

vegan,Please stop being so militant,"Hi everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been vegan for about 5 years. In the true sense of the word. No lab-tested products, no honey, no leather, no dairy, no meat etc.

I did it because I wanted first and foremost my health and the extension of that for the environment which, I know, crazy, has an impact on my health. 

There are several of you that care more about shaming people than you do about helping them do the right thing. If going ""vegetarian"" is the bridge that someone needs to ditch all meat and then eventually dairy, why make them feel bad. Great, they're not as enlightened as you. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please, take a look at the vegan voices that help and oppose voices that actually hurt this community. 

&amp;#x200B;

I personally look at [Earthling Ed: Vegan Educator &amp; Public Speaker](https://earthlinged.org/). He doesn't make someone feel bad about themselves and I promise you he's helped more people to become vegan than the condescending gatekeeping I see here so much. I won't preach. This will be the first and last post I make on this sub.

vegan,Today marks my 5th vegan anniversary and everyone's shitty reaction was exactly what I expected,"Hey everyone!

Today is my 5-year vegan birthday and to be honest, I couldn't be more proud. Im 22 now, became vegan at 17 after a stupid bet that changed my life. I know exactly 0 vegans and am just inspired by this sub/community every day.

I truly love being vegan. I don't miss meat, I dont feel like a hypocrite, I am healthier than ever, I am fit (relatively) and I am a better cook than I could've dreamed of. I still have a BIG WAY to go as there are many recipes I haven't tried, many vegetables I still hate (lets be honest, its mostly cauliflower) and tougher skin to develop as I still am pretty rude to people with stupid opinions.

The biggest problem about today was telling my friends and family.  My family told me ""of course we are not proud, why would we be? We think you have a bad lifestyle and disagree entirely, as you know"" and my friends just ignored it (and some unfollows on Instagram, but fuck them). 

Nonetheless, I am very proud of myself and of all this community. Every day we save animals. 5 years is a lot of babies that were not viciously murdered, I just wanted to share this goal with you all. Thank you for being the vegan community I dont have, I really really appreciate you guys. We are not victims, not extremists and not assholes: we are animal loving people that will fight 10 assholes a day to protect our values."

Do vegan labelled foods use bone char sugar? Or do they source their refined sugar from producers who don’t use that practice?   

Do food producers who have no direct animal products that say their product is vegan take into account the sugar? Or do they just assume, like I did, sugar is a plant therefore it is vegan friendly?

vegan,My day 1 of becoming a vegan,"Last night I watched the ""What the health"" and it made me think a lot about my personal health and the diseases that are in my family (cancer, high blood pressure, heart diseases etc), so I just kind of decided on a whim in the middle of the docuementary to give veganism a shot.

Backstory: I'm a 24 year old guy, 6'3 240lbs decently muscular but also 20+lbs of excess fat which I want to get rid of obviously. Me and my family have eaten a TON of meat during my upbringing, my family is quite wealthy, so steak dinners, chicken, pork, fish etc on almost every single dinnertime was normal for me. I'm probably in the top 1% of people who have eaten the most meat for their entire life if adjusted for age. (sorry)

Day 1 of me going vegan consisted of me going to the store and buying a shit ton of veggies, fruits, hummus, some crackers, soda and frozen vegan burgers.

I decided to try to cook 1 vegan burger, and it looked pretty good, Im a decent chef but I ended up taking 1 bite and being completely disgusted, the fake meat was really not good.

However I wont give up, I decided to make some roasted sweet potato, and Im gonna eat some oats with peanut butter and maybe more hummus for the rest of the day.

Im sorry to say this, but I do not care that much about animals, I barely had any pets growing up (1 small parrot) due to my brother having bad allergies. The health benefits are why I am going to attempt to go fully vegan, Im giving myself a week or maybe a month to test it fully out and see if it is for me.

Feel free to try to convince me of more health benefits or some comments about what i wrote :)"
vegan,Dating a non-vegan,"I always said I could never be with someone who isn't vegan, it's too important to me that my partner and I share the same core values. Then, a few months ago, I fell in love with a girl who isn't vegan and whose parents run a dairy farm.

She's intelligent, open-minded and compassionate, so I convinced myself she'd go vegan soon enough. I'm still somewhat optimistic that she will, though it's hard for her because recognising that exploiting and killing animals is wrong means condemning what her family does. She's worried that seeing the world from a vegan perspective would ruin her relationship with her family and also her childhood memories of growing up on a farm.

Now here's the issue... Normally I'm pretty good at supporting people on their path to veganism, being compassionate, understanding, patient and supportive, and laying out the arguments for veganism in a way that doesn't make the other person get defensive. Unfortunately, lately I've been very impatient with my girlfriend. I bring up the topic way too often, I try too hard to convince her and sometimes I'm pretty unpleasant about it. I've repeatedly set the intention to be more chill, and failed repeatedly. This is something I'm struggling with massively at the moment.

I think the urge to convince her stems primarily from the fact that if she doesn't go vegan I will have to break up with her sooner or later. I want to avoid that potential future more than anything. The thing is, by being obtrusive, I'm ruining our relationship and pushing her away. I'm bringing about the future I wish to avoid.

I'm confused and overwhelmed by the whole situation, I don't know how to think or feel, or how to frame it appropriately. Comments/advice would be greatly appreciated!"
vegan,Vegetarian Dietitian Recommends Chicken Soups After Weight Loss Surgery,"Hello everyone, my friend just had Gastric Sleeve 5 days ago (weight loss surgery). She has recently being feeling weak and dizzy the past 2 days. She is a vegetarian and her clinic dietitian (who also claims to be a vegetarian) has strongly recommended that she consume house and chicken juices because she's not getting enough nutrients from her protein shakes and multi-vitamins alone. 

She doesn't want to consume any meat or chicken juices of any kind so she told asked her dietitian if she can consume tofu instead. Here is the message her Dietitian replied back with. Just as a note after having weight loss surgery, particularly Gastric Sleeve, the patient needs to consume liquids for the first 2 weeks of post surgery. 

Anyway, I am a vegan myself and I don't agree with what her Dietitian recommends and don't think my friend needs to consume animal products for a full recovery. What do you guys think of this? I really want to help her.

Yesterday, my church had an ice cream social after  night of worship.  She got a dairy ice cream cone, I got a tangerine fruit bar (vegan).

vegan,Week 1 of Veganism (low-ish carbs),"It's important to share my diet prior to veganism: 

Breakfast included 8 Oz of broccoli, 1/3 a cabbage, 1 potato, a whole avocado. 

After breakfast shake included 10 grams of spirulina, 5 grams of creatine monohydrate, and vitamins (including maca and ashwagandha). Chugged. 

Lunch/dinner was a 2 liter smoothie including cucumber, asparagus, spinach, and 1/2 an avocado. 

Dinner was 1/2 lb of ground meat and goat cheese. 

So, I was already eating a lot of vegetables! 

Now, I've added tofu to my first and last meals (45 grams of protein per day) and added 5 tablespoons of hemp seeds to my shake. Also added some fun fruits and tomatoes. Obviously, removed the meat and cheese. 

This is a more diverse diet and it gives me a tremendous amount of energy. I'm actually sleeping less too; seemingly, because my increased energy levels.

vegan,How can I avoid groundbeef in chili? [while having a good balance of flavour],"I've been making chili my whole life, it's a goto easy freezable food.

&amp;#x200B;

For a few months I only made vegan chili and it was, meh... no matter what i did. When i added ground beef back it was a different world. I started putting less and less in, so now it's only about 1/4 pound per 4L batch. I think it's the fats in the groundbeef that are critical for the flavour. So, what can I use instead to get that same satisifying flavour for my chili... my food science knowledge is limited, but I'm guessing I need something fatty that is vegan.

&amp;#x200B;

My core recipe is: 1 can of diced tomatoes, can of tom paste, can of tom sauce, can of corn, can of 3 diff beans, onions fried in veg oil, an absurd amount of chili powder, some salt, and some msg.

So, what can i try adding for that grease/fat flavour instead of groundbeef?"
vegan,"Opinions on people who went vegan/vegetarian then revert back to meat bc ""they were feeling so bad and now they feel so much better after eating meat again.""","I came across a youtube channel where a girl was vegetarian for 14 years then started eating fish again bc her health ""was deteriorating"" and now she feels so much better. She says things like ""my neurons are firing again!"" and whatever else. A bunch of her commenters say the same thing, ""I went vegan for 4 years and I felt so horrible, I started eating meat again and feel so much better!""  


Personally, I think these people just didn't do their research on the diet and probably primarily eat carbs and some fat and don't get enough protein (I know I know but hear me out) when I talk to ordinary people, the substitutions they make for meat are mainly carb-based or nothing.  ""I had pasta, but just without the meat or cheese!"" or ""I use vegan cheese instead of dairy cheese in my quesadillas"" or ""I'm so healthy I ate a whole salad with lettuce and tomato and peppers! no meat!"" but they fail to realize they aren't still getting the same nutrients, they are just taking their protein source away and eating the rest of the meal. 

&amp;#x200B;

I find it hard to believe that SO MANY PEOPLE seem to have a problem when they \*say\* they are eating a diet full of enough proteins, fats, and carbs in the right amount, with a wide variety of food. I'm not sure how so many people are feeling horrible with this diet,  UNLESS you have a medical problem.  (Chrohn's or IBS sometimes reacts badly to legumes and a lot of veggies and cruciferous veg.)  Or they literally are just not eating the right nutrients (carb heavy or junk food vegan type person)  


It's just frustrating and I would like your opinions."
vegan,What is the purpose of products like the beyond burger?,"Something me and members of my family have been questioning/confounded by is the need to make vegan/vegeterian food that looks like meat like the beyond burgers and similar products. Is the point to get meat eaters to eat vegan/vegetarian food or is it for vegans? And a small side question what is your opinion on test-tube meat i.e. meat made artificially?

P.S. I know vegan and vegeterian are different things."
vegan,I need to vent (family issues),"for context I have been vegan 9 years for ethical reasons and that isn't going to change anytime soon (or ever). my mom called me last night to try to talk about how she ""is starting to eat more dairy"" because it's ""good for the bones"" and suggested I also start doing this. I got really upset because not only is what she is saying healthwise completely not true and dairy propaganda but she also doesn't respect my choices and she knows there is a 0% chance I will just say ""oh thanks for the tip I will go chug a glass of hormone torture filled milk right now"". then she started asking me what vegan foods have calcium?? like she doesn't realize exercise is the most important thing for having good bones meanwhile she doesn't leave the house or exercise ever. 

also she is east Asian and basically all east Asians are severely lactose intolerant, and how tf is it healthy to consume something you literally can't digest. I tried explaining this to her and she just didn't even take it in.

then she started crying saying she just wants the best for me and for me to be healthy then I felt bad like maybe I was too rude. but at the same time she was the one coming at me talking about how I need to eat meat and dairy to be healthy meanwhile she has prediabetes. 

I don't know how she can think this is a viable conversation after literally 9 years. I never bring up her food choices and make her feel bad about them but conversations like these really make me want to start doing that, even though it's a total dead end. 

anyways I just needed to vent, I understand she's coming from a place of care for me but it frustrates me how she goes about it. if she actually wanted to help me she would send me a list of vegan foods with lots of calcium or something. 

if anyone has good resources about how being vegan is healthy and dairy is bad that would also be appreciated. although she is the type of person who always thinks she's right so idk how much I can convince her. 

anyways thanks for reading y'all 💕"

vegan,How to be vegetarian? I eat crappy food and am lazy,I’m in my mid 20’s. When I was a kid I watched a horrible video of a cow getting killed and screaming in a meat factory. After that I was a vegetarian for about 10 years. I don’t know why but I started eating a lot of meat and just didn’t care to be vegetarian. I love animals and would like to atleast be vegetarian but would like to eventually be vegan. When I was vegetarian I would eat alot of junk food. I didn’t really know how to properly eat like a vegetarian. I was also a kid so that’s probably why. I have a 4 month old baby and I won’t lie I’m really lazy when it comes to making food. But I’m trying really hard to make healthy meals and not just grab fast food. Also did anyone breastfeed as a vegetarian/vegan?
vegan,I need inspiration.,"Hello,  
I bought a vegan milker from Aldi two days ago and I've been vigorously using it to make milk from trail mix, pistachios.. (I have never seen pistachio milk; it tastes so good though?!) Now to my question: What can I do with the remains (tiny bits of nuts), after pressing out the milk? Can I use it to make bars? I read I can use to make vegan cheese? And I'm not only talking about pistachios or walnuts.. Give me all your ideas!

Thankful for any inspiration, have a great day!!"
vegan,How to contact r/vegan moderators?,"Hi folks! I had a post in r/vegan this morning that sparked really awesome and thought-provoking conversation (16 net upvotes and 2 awards in less than an hour) about the general toxicity of vegans on this r/vegan toward non-vegans and whether it's actually productive for the animals. But despite the community support and the great conversation, the r/vegan moderators removed the post, and I'd like to know why. Does anyone know how to contact them? Thanks!"
vegan,Vegan Instant Ramen,"So I'll start by acknowledging that I am aware that they are unhealthy but I really enjoy Ramen and like to have some every now and then.

I don't live in the US so my options are fairly limited however, the supermarkets carry brands such as Nongshim,  Samyang, and Jin Ramen in various flavors. 

I looked at the ingredients &amp; allergens on these products and they don't seem to contain any animal products but I still can't say for sure that they are vegan.  


If you do enjoy this kind of food I'd really appreciate recommendations on which are vegan."
vegan,Can we all PLEASE stop being so toxic? You and I weren't born vegan either.,"I'm relatively new to this subreddit, and I've been blown away by the level of utterly counterproductive toxicity among vegans on r/vegan toward anyone starting their plant-based journey. It has to stop.

Implying that people who have just started cutting back on meat (and are asking for advice from vegans) are rapists and murderers is only going to push them away. This judging, diminishing, and criticizing of newcomers is incredibly counterproductive, and I really, really wish the MAJORITY of r/vegan members would stop doing it, because the animals, the planet, and the starving people in the world, do not care AT ALL how self-righteous and superior you get to feel today. But if you push that newcomer away from plant-based ideas, YOU are killing the animals you pushed them back toward eating. The animal isn't thinking in the gas chamber, ""Man, I might be dying because a vegan felt the need to be super caustic to someone on Reddit, but I sure am glad they got to make their point!""

So let's all stop being toxic to newcomers, vegetarians, and meatless Monday-ers. You weren't born vegan either,  we all arrived at veganism differently, and literally NO ONE goes vegan because some self-righteous asshole vegan on reddit screamed at them. But I'm sure that's made numerous people decide NOT to go vegan, because it's easy to leave r/vegan thinking, ""Wow, vegans suck."" Instead, let's keep it productive, positive, and compassionate, because that's the best way to actually encourage positive change, and if we really care about animals, that positive change is all that matters :) 

Stepping off my soap box now. Thanks, and have a great day!"
vegan,First Trimester - Craving eggs!?,"Good morning! Look, I’m pregnant and after 3+ years of not eating animal products all I want is fried egg on toast. 

Someone please smack me with all the facts and reminders why we don’t eat them so I can go back to be nauseated by the thought. Pregnancy-brain is a trip. 

**all my dr’s and OBs are on board and supportive of this vegan pregnancy. Some people scream that pregnant people need eggs for the protein and choline and that’s not even my concern - I know I’m covered nutritionally."
vegan,"As a vegan, how do you cope with living in a non vegan society?","I am vegan because I am kind and hate making innocent ones suffer. I believe animals deserve respect just as us humans do. It is really hard for me because I am vegan for the animals and yet people still pay for such cruelty. I try to tell people the truth but they deal with so much cognitive dissonance because they have been accustomed to eating meat. But I wish that everyone was vegan because it’s ridiculous how much people still don’t know the truth and when u tell them the truth u get bullied for it or u have to deal with their excuses. So my question is, how do u guys manage to live in a currently non vegan world?"
vegan,Slugs and dogs,"We have a lovely little dog and a garden full of slugs. Slugs can be deadly to dogs if they eat them and of course our little dog is obsessed with trying to get them. 

I am wondering how other people manage this with minimal disruption to slugs. Picking them up and moving them just isn't practical as we live in a country with plenty of rain so they are constantly there. I know most people will say throw down poison to kill them but I was hoping maybe someone here has a better solution?

If you have a dog how do you manage this?"
vegan,Working with an unethical client (I'm mad),"I'm really mad at the moment and finding it hard to articulate, so I apologize if this reads like a mess...  


So recently my workplace has been driving a new business partnership to bring on the states Greyhound Racing Body as a client.   


For those who aren't aware of the issues of Greyhound Racing in Australia - As a quick overview - each state has a Racing Board which is supposed to regulate and monitor the industry, while also promoting the growth of the sport - which is a massive conflict of interests. As a result, the board turns a blind eye to disgusting cruelty, including illegal live baiting, and estimates of 16,000-18,000 Dogs being murdered each year because they aren't fast enough to race competitively, and would be too expensive to keep. (This makes my blood boil)  


Now back to my work - I have told our CEO I will not work on this project, and sent him an email saying we should consider how working with a client like that would affect our brand - (We generally have a very progressive and ethical image in our industry) - he said we can discuss it - but he never brought it up again and has continued to drive business talks with the client.   


I am so angry about this - Mainly because my company always paints itself as ""The Forward Thinking Good Guys"" - it makes me feel so cynical that everything we do in terms of Mental Health, Female Empowerment, Employment Diversity, Fundraisers for Cancer Funds etc etc is all just Virtue Signalling bullshit.   
I feel like none of it is worth anything, and is all just a fake.   
It makes me mad that other senior members of my firm, who I thought were good people, haven't spoken up.  
It makes me mad all my co-workers who post pictures of themselves cuddling their dogs on LinkedIn are going to be happy to work with the #1 Dog Killer in Australia.  
It makes me not want to participate in any more work activities other than my job itself.  


Has anyone been in a similar situation to this? Do I need to sort myself out and move on? Sometimes I feel like maybe I am being a little too entitled. Should I really put the pressure on my colleagues to opt-out of this project too? I feel like I have lost all faith in the company I used to love and it's infuriating."

vegan,my 3rd the try to go vegan. Any tips or tricks to go vegan for cheap also is beyond meat and vegan egg and cheese substitute worth it.,"I've tried to go vegan many times but I failed miserably because one I thought it was really expensive when actually it's really cheap. 
Two I just didn't know how to throw food together because I'm raised in a very Southern home and I'm used to eating really thick heavy meals and my mother cooked like a old southern baptist woman everyday for a long time so I'm used to very thick heavy meals. So anything that y'all can give to me to help me at this point will be a miracle because I am tired of eating meat and I know that sounds weird. But something about me doesn't do it for me like the beef and chicken taste weird and I don't know why nobody notices this"
vegan,Is it strange that i don’t have much empathy but still doesn’t want animals to die?,"I know i‘m probably gonna get alot of hate for this, but i just don’t really have any empathy for animals, or humans either. I watch alot of gore and when i first watched i hated it, but now i‘m just neutral about it. I don’t really feel anything when i watch animal slaughter vids but i still don’t want them to die and i still try to eat less meat. Is it weird to have less empathy and still care for animals though?"

vegan,Will I be fine for a couple of months or so living on bread and beans? In terms of nutrients,"Lost my job, having trouble getting one due to my health conditions. Right now I live on homemade bread and beans. I also take multivitamins with minerals. I really can't afford anything else and my credit cards maxed out. I think I should be fine for a couple of months like this? I mean in terms of getting enough nutrients and such?"
vegan,Struggling with a few different issues,"I am going to try to not make this a massive ramble but I have a few different issues I have encountered over the past year and a bit. 

So firstly and most recently, I have just moved out and I do not have much money at all, I am still managing to save a bit but I am really budgeting for food and everything, so I am looking for cheap vegan cosmetics for males, if anyone could point me towards communities or resources that can help that would be great.

So me (19M) became plant based at 16, exactly three years ago today. I say plant based because I had no intention of becoming vegan, and planned to give myself a ""cheat"" meal once a month and eventually get chickens and only eat their dead animal part (twisted I know), but after my first ""cheat meal"" i felt awful and felt very sick for like a week so I cut that out. I also have ADHD and a big symptom is I get into massive rabbit holes of researching things constantly if I am interested about it. I didn't think a plant based diet was sustainable long term, but the more I researched the more I realised how healthy it can be, and how environmentally damaging it was, i also started to watch a few Earthling Ed videos but I was still a slave to my conditioning. Anyway fast forward a bit and I watched dominion with my current girlfriend. That completely twisted me like nothing else in my life, as I am from Australia myself I was absolutely disgusted with myself, and my arrogance, and this absolutely filthy system that had been created. At this time I was also reading 1984, and by reading that book at the same time I started to realise how twisted the world I am living in is, like seriously the similarities are insane, such as the use of euphemisms and how sickening it is when you think about it. Anyway, after that I started learning everything about the ethical argument, trying to find any flaws and to be objective as possible, obviously I could find none. Fast forward about a year I was sharing what I was learning with my current friends, people I thought I could be myself around. Still I saw little change in their actions, and felt broken by the clear hypocrisy in them, and everyone I knew. To put things into perspective I had been very good friends with these people for over half my life, and we were somewhat like minded in our interests. When I turned 18 I was drinking a lot, as most teens do. I was starting to become less happy, and when I drank it made me feel happy because it made me to dumb to think about how twisted everything is. Anyway after a night out a ""friend"" said he put chicken fat in my slushie, I got mad because I thought he was serious, I didn't really like this guy already because he was a compulsive liar, and just has no concept of boundaries, so I got mad, this led to a ""close friend"" saying he can never joke about veganism, which led to me jokingly mocking him telling him to be proud of what he pays for (he is a very self righteous prick, and was obviously not pleased with how cows and pigs are treated yet would still mock my food, and eat large amounts of dead animals) nobody else took it seriously except for him and another ""friend"" long story short this led to them verbally abusing me and blocking me because they felt to insecure about their actions, nothing like this had happened before. when I tried to talk about this to about several of my friends they would not comment on it, and would say little, or they would gaslight me or say I talk to much about veganism. This led to me disconnecting myself from veganism, pretty much not watching any videos or anything. I come from a some what rough community so I had no other vegans, and I already struggled telling people, and to this day I still do and try to hide it as much as possible. This also led to me not caring about my health and drinking way more, about three times a week heavy drinking, it got to the point where I craved beer a lot and gained 10kg in about 6 months. Prior to this I was 10kg lighter and over 2x stronger. After school we had a trip we preplanned with some of these ""friends"". I was driving and they asked me to go to one of my old ""friends"" who blocked me and verbally abused me, I said no to which they all started to awkwardly ask me to go. I was so pissed off and said to them all I do not want to speak to you after this trip. That's what I sorta did, and reflecting I realised what pissed me off was the lack of support from my friends, and just the gaslighting amongst other issues. This led me with a bunch of issues with relationships and a complete lack of friends. Fast forward to now I want to see a psychologist/therapist to try and resolve my issues of identity and relationships, as I feel as though I cut people off as soon as I see issues with them. I feel like I don't want to as I am a male and have hardly ever opened up and all my issues revolve around veganism, and I feel like unless the person was vegan they wouldn't understand or be able to help. 

&amp;#x200B;

My second reason for going to a psychologist/therapist is I recently broke up with my girlfriend of almost three years. The reasoning was because she wanted to get married and have kids, I'm not sure if I want to, and she is not vegan. We started dating when I was only plant based, but she watched dominion with me and seemed more upset then me, further she was the only person I would talk to about the hypocrisies etc, and watch related documentries with, yet she wasn't vegan. I could not wrap my head around it and would ask her if she had any reasons or anything, and she didn't. It was simply due to convenience and family. I was hurt by it everyday, it would frustrate me because she would eat vegan when with me which is obviously better then nothing, but it was like living in some fairytale because I knew when she got home she would eat dead animal parts. It was also annoying because I felt as if she just did it for me, not because she cared, I also really struggle to respect anyone if they eat dead animals just because of the hypocrisy, and obviously a romantic relationship can't work well without respect. I haven't told anyone I broke up with her due to veganism despite that being the main reason, she is very upset, as am I because we had an amazing relationship apart from that and a few other issues, like a lot better then most people our age, and its really killing me, I feel like I'm losing everyone because of it, and I would like to talk toa therapist/psychologist about that but again I feel like they wouldn't understand.

So if anyone has any insights or similarities to my situation and think they can help I'm all ears, especially in regards to my relationship because I am feeling conflicted and not sure if I made a mistake"
vegan,#Swedengate got me thinking about how people treat vegan dinner guests/hosts,"A bit late for this maybe, idk if anyone's still talking about it, but I only just found out #Swedengate lol. I was pretty disgusted with how much of the internet were condemning a whole country for having a different custom about food/hospitality (I'm aware that some Swedes say it's not really a thing anymore or it was being misunderstood and exaggerated, but that's beside the point). I can certainly understand why it may seem odd or rude to people who grew up where food was always served to guests no matter what, but it's the case for many food related customs, what is rude in one country may be the polite thing in another (like slurping broth/noodles). Usually we don't question it, as the saying goes when it Rome do as the Romans do.

What really got me was the people who celebrate that they/their culture will basically force feed guests and pressure them even if they refuse. How is that any more hospitable than the worst of what Swedes are being accused of? Unfortunately I know these people to be very real and they are not even exaggerating. I was born and raised vegan, I always had to refuse food at bdays, dinners, slumberparties. It never bothered me to do so, but it sure seemed to bother adults around me and I was often made to feel uncomfortable for it. It even caused me to lose a friend. I was over at their house once and even though I said I was vegan and had already eaten and didn't mind not eating (I did sit at the table and accepted a drink, thinking that was more polite), her parents repeatedly insisted I should eat, put food on my plate saying it was vegan (it was some soggy frozen vegetables drowned in butter). I tried explaining that butter was not vegan and they did not understand, kept saying it was just vegetables and felt it was rude that I wouldn't eat what they specifically made for me. I ended up crying and calling my mom to pick me up early. My friend basically stopped talking to me after that.

I've also had people refuse to eat food I made and offered to them simply because it was vegan and they didn't want to eat vegan food. I never let it offend me, but if this is a common occurence for other vegans then perhaps people are not as ""hospitable"" as they think. Honestly I think the Swedes are on to something. IMO no one should be pressured to provide for or accept food simply as a matter of hospitality, unless it is a preplanned event where all individuals dietary needs are known (and even then sometimes it's impossible to cater to everyone)."
vegan,Is there a name for vegans who eat oysters (or not purely plant-based)?,"I’ve been a vegetarian for the past 5 years but I’ve recently (2 weeks ago) become vegan. I noticed one of my coworker never ate meat/dairy products, but would occasionally eat oysters. 

I asked him in one lunch small talk if he was vegan, and he told me that he was a vegan, but not purely plant-based. When I asked him about the oysters, he said “I am a vegan to minimize unnecessary suffering. Oysters lack a central nervous system or pain receptors, they lack the ability to feel pain, and therefore eating them is vegan. They are able to respond to stimuli in the same way plants can.”.

Now I’m far from a debater on veganism (especially that I became vegan literally a few weeks ago), but I was wondering if this is a common stance?"
vegan,Vegan Cat food Advice,"I've been feeding 8 cats Evolution cat food.  My 2 adults cats have been on it for ~1 year.  And adult stray has been coming in my cat door and eating it for ~4 months.  That adult stray gave birth to 5 kittens in my bath tub and they eat it too, though they still nurse.

Problem is none of these 8 cats love it.  They'll eat it if there's nothing else.  I don't think it's bad for them.  But when I got some KMR 2nd step to take some pressure off the nursing mother all the cats went crazy for it (though it gave them all diarrhea for a few days).  I allow all the cats free entry and exit from my home.  I know for sure at least one of my cats hunts and eat her kills.  I'm sure the stray does too.  I'd like all the cats to not only have a ready supply of healthy food but to actually enjoy eating it.  The problem is getting Evolution kibble to taste good.

I've discovered that if I mix mostly Evolution with a bit of KMR 2nd step powder and water they really go for it.  It doesn't take much KMR powder to get the effect.  I don't want to do this long term since KMR has whey and some adult cats can't tolerate it well.  So I'm wondering, does anyone know a good meat powder to mix with plant-based kibble?  I don't like to buy animal ag products even for cats but it seems like I wouldn't need to buy very much to augment the Evolution so that my cats really enjoy eating again.

Bone powder?  Egg powder?  Anyone have a winning formula?

For anyone on the fence about feeding their cat plant based cat food I recommend giving this a try!"

vegan,Question about offsetting,"From vegan perspective, if someone donates a lot to fund research into plant based alternatives or lab grown meat meat and puts in effort to consume humanely raised and painlessly killed meat, would this be an acceptable compromise?

vegan,Are Butler Soy Curls and bulk soy protein effectively/functionally the same thing?,"I've been using Butler Soy Curls for a while, and I really like them, but I can't get them locally. Recently I found bulk soy protein at a local Asian market, that looks very similar to soy curls. Yesterday, I bought some, rehydrated it like I do for soy curls, and it smells and tastes very similar. It doesn't quite look the same, because the soy curls have been formed to resemble meat strips (like chicken) and the bulk soy is just nuggets. 

The ingredients on the soy curls package just says ""whole soybeans"", and their [How Are Soy Curls Made?](https://butlerfoods.com/soycurlsmade.html) page says they take whole soybeans, soak them in water, and then dry them. I read elsewhere that soy protein is the result of extracting the oil from the beans, and saving what's left. 

So, is there any reason why I shouldn't use the bulk soy protein instead of the Butler Soy Curls in my dishes? IOW, is there some big red flag I'm missing?

Here's a photo of both: [Soy Curls and bulk soy protein](https://imgur.com/a/Ngd9KPB)"
vegan,Do you guys feel guilty about liking non-vegan characters in tv series or movies?,"Sorry if its a dumb question in digital entertainment industry specially in older series you hardly see the vegan element or characters, like I was obsessed with joey(from friends) at one point, but one of his characteristics was that he was foody, and he is eating chicken, turkeys and whatnot. So just wanted to ask how you guys feel about it and how you enjoy such shows cause for me its bit of tricky area and at times I don't know how to feel about it."
vegan,"""I don't eat veal because they keep them in cages and don't let their muscles develop."" ""...but you eat dairy.""","I don't often feel the need to vent about day to day carnist thoughts (most because I avoid the confrontation because all it does is piss me off and stress me out) but this just happened and I need to cool off.

My (also vegan) sibling and I were talking about what we ate when we each visited Montreal and I mentioned I had osso buco (pre vegan days) and they were roasting me about how I ate baby cow.  I didn't actually realize it was veal, but obviously I am against all animal consumption now so it's all equally bad to me.  At the time however, I absolutely would have thought veal was unethical compared to other meat.

So my sibling decides to bring that up with our mom and she immediately gets defensive saying she would never eat veal and she absolutely did not have veal that time she and my dad had osso buco in Florida.  I told her ""but you eat lamb"" and she replied ""I don't eat veal because they keep them in cages and don't let them develop their muscles.  She looked it up and sometimes the dish is made with pork, as if that's any better.  Of course she went full defense saying ""oh I'm just a horrible person"" and trying to defend how not veal is better than veal.  I finished off by telling her that the reason she has dairy is because of those baby cows kept in cages.  

My family eats majority of the same meals, so about 90% WFPB.  My sibling and I are vegan.  My parents do enjoy vegan cooking and my mom gladly makes vegan meals.  But this ""reducetarian"" mindset of ""I eat less meat and not certain kinds so it's better"" drives me up the wall.  I avoid these conversations where I can because they are absolutely illogical arguments.  I told my mom that I think people have to be comfortable with the reality of eating meat if they're going to do it.  If people at least knew what they were doing and didn't argue about the reality then fine.  At least they're not sticking their head in the sand.  But this is absolutely insane and crazy making.  Thanks for letting me get that off my chest."
vegan,Sleeping a lot now that I’m vegan,"Hi everyone.

Recently became vegan. So far so good. I’ve been having very diverse meals, plenty of calories, plenty of protein. Example is what I ate the other day : protein shake, nuts, wraps, apple, acai bowl, felafel platter, protein shake.

Anyway, I just woke up from sleeping eleven hours. The other day I slept ten hours. I typically don’t sleep more than 7.

Have any of you experienced this? Is my body getting exhausted from deficiency or is it getting what it needs and being able to rest more?

vegan,"What is the proper amount of b12? My sublingual pills are 5,000mcg","I have been vegan for over four years. When I first started I was a bit better at taking a b12 supplement, but once I had an acne breakout I cut it out due to fear. Turns out my acne is hormonal and not b12 induced. 

I have been feeling fatigue for a while now. I feel brain fog and almost zombie like. For some reason this is how I feel until mid afternoon, and by that time my brain feels fully awake. I am in a massive sleep debt due to my job which I am working to make up, but I also wonder if there’s a possible nutrient deficiency. I eat extremely healthy because I’m into fitness, but as a vegan I realized I am still prone to deficiencies.

vegan,what could replace peanuts??,"I made the very unfortunate discovery that peanuts are a big contributing factor to my acne. I saw some stuff online that prompted me to quit peanuts for a couple weeks as an experiment (apparently all the omega 6 is inflammatory for the skin and I already have bad adult hormonal acne) and I noticed a huge difference, which is great and terrible at the same time because I want clear skin but I eat SO MANY peanut products. I often go through 2 16 oz jars of peanut butter a week and often supplemented with regular roasted peanuts as snacks. I never ate the sugary kind, just the peanuts+salt kind, so I know it's not the sugar or seed oils, it's the peanuts.

So what could replace them? It was such a staple in my diet because it was high in fat, decent protein, and super cheap. I can't afford tons of avocados and other nut butters. there have to be peanut free people out there making it work. what are your suggestions?"
vegan,What did you do with non-food animal products after going vegan?,"This question has been on my mind lately. When I went from near-vegan vegetarian to 100% vegan two years ago, I had no problem throwing away a few food items that I found disgusting. As much as I try to avoid waste, I knew I'd be healthier without that stuff.

It's a little more complicated with non-food items like clothing. If you wear it, you're promoting its use. If you throw it away, it will go to a landfill and contribute to all the waste that's out there. If you give it away, someone else will wear it.

So I have kind of a flexible attitude, phasing out non-food items over time, replacing them with vegan options when necessary and when I can afford it (cost is also a factor here).

The textile industry harms animals, whether the clothing uses animal products or not. Really, the only vegan option is to second hand and avoid waste. And yet not everything can be bought second hand (underwear, some kinds of athletic clothes, shoes that need to be in good condition for work etc). So you're always just doing the best you can, given the circumstances.

I'm curious about how other people have handled this. What did you do with any non-food animal products you owned after you went vegan?"
vegan,"IBS, fibre, allergies","I stopped being vegan a while ago due to extreme bloating, cramps and IBS flare-ups from eating too much fibre and some allergies (sesame seeds mainly). Does anyone have suggestions for avoiding flare-ups and reducing fibre intake on a vegan diet? Should I just avoid high FODMAP foods? I really want to get back to veganism because it means so much to me but the constant gassiness, burping etc just got extremely tiring. I'm gonna visit a doctor as well of course I just thought maybe asking for some advice first could be a good start."
vegan,I don't recognize myself,"I'm vegan for almost a year now, currently in bad Crohn's flare up. And it's getting harder and harder to deal with. I'm losing weight week by week, feel progressively weaker and I can't even eat beans or lentils anymore because I feel like dying after. I sustain on sugared drinks to get any calories, pb&amp;j toasts and some mushroom dumplings. 

The longer it all looks like that, I'm finding myself craving eggs and butter like crazy. And I feel awful about it, trying to talk sense to myself, because I start to reason eating animal products more and more and I hate it. I just feel vulnerable and scared and im so much pain, but now also guilty and ashamed of myself :(

I've come back from hospital 2 days ago, and because I basically vanish away they gaved me some medical-nutrition products to help me sustain until I can get bio-meds in August, but they're not vegan as well :')

vegan,What is wrong with plant-based diets?,"I am a vegan who follows an exculsively plant-based diet, because I feel healthier that way. And I also don't go to zoo's, buy leather etc.

But I've recently seen a lot of hate here for plant-based diets. I don't understand that. 

So for example Coca Cola would be vegan, but I don't drink that, because I **also** care about my health.

But that seems to be taboo here, you should only care about animals, not about yourself.

I don't get it, so I would like to have someone explain it."

vegan,Eating Eggs,"I grew up with chickens all around me. My parents, my grandparents, my aunt and uncle, etc…
Whenever I had some, they were always just strictly pets, never food. I absolutely adore chickens!

Well, the main reason I went vegan was because of the harsh treatment animals experienced in order for people to eat/buy their products. 
I was wondering what everyone thought of owning your own chickens and eating unfertilized eggs that they lay.

I’d know that my chickens would be in the best care. I mean, they’d be my pets.

But I'm going to stop now. I'm writing this because I needed to say something to someone who would hear it and wouldn't just tell me it's okay to cheat on my diet. This diet isn't one it's okay to cheat on.
Is there any advice someone can give me to help me quit meat completely?"
vegan,I hit a deer with my car today,"Today I was driving home from a party late at night (I did not drink) and was driving through some forest roads, it would take me about an hour to get home.

I was going the speed limit and I saw a deer jump out of some bushes into the road and quickly hit the brakes and I was braking as hard as I could, ABS kicking in hard and I saw my car getting closer and closer and thought I would miss it but towards the end there was a slight bump as I hit the deer. The deer fell to the ground and rolled into the ditch next to the road. It kicked a bit but quickly stopped moving. I believe it died very quickly. I called the police as per law in my country for them to send a hunter. For some reason it took an hour on the phone to finally get through to the police and the deer seemed completely dead. I kicked it lightly a few times and it did not move, eyes open so it must have been dead. 

I am going to be honest, I feel sorry that it happend and wish it didnt but it did and I do not think I could have done anything else in the given situation. I wonder if this is something people might comment on considering me being vegan, as if its ""extra bad"" for this to happen to me with me since I often need to go out of my way to find food that contains no meat dairy or eggs. 

It has made me think about it for a while and I do not feel any great sorrow for the particular animal, it had a tragic accident and it met its fate. What I feel about it is more about what choices humans make without thinking about consequences. I never wanted to hurt this animal but others choose to make decisions that greatly affect other lives. 

A quote this has made me think about from star trek by jean-luc picard goes ""It is possible to commit no mistake and still lose. That is not weakness, that is life."""

vegan,"I am not Vegan for ethical reasons only, i am simply disgusted by eating animal products","I have seen some Vegans who crave some previously fond-of animal product; and then at times going as far as to make ab plant-based version of said product. The truth is, for me; I have always just felt squeemish and even down-right gross about eating animal products. Could never stomach the thought.

That it came out of another living being--or worse--the very flesh of a now dead being, makes me want to retch. I have absolutey zero craving for animal products. So it shocks me to see so many people being so in love with meat. 

I don't do it just for the animals, but because I don't want to vomit."

It's not.

I'm sick of people taking it upon themselves to graft onto me whatever they need so they can get along with me and feel comfortable eating their disgusting animal corpses in front of me.

vegan,I need some advice.,"I know, I know. It's pathetic that the idea of animal suffering hasn't stopped me from consuming animal products. But I'm in a sticky situation:
I live with my parents and sister who encourage me to not be vegan. My mom is convinced that animal products are necessary to have a healthy diet. 
I have a junk food addiction, and the only food that's junky that comes into the house is not vegan. I don't want to bring more junk food into the house (even if it is vegan) because I'm trying to change my diet. This causes a problem, though. I end up having some vegan food in the house that's healthy and therefore unappealing, and then my sister will come home with a bucket of ice cream. Even while knowing that animal suffering is crucial for making ice cream, and even while knowing that I need to be eating more healthily, my brain is telling me, ""Eat the ice cream. Eat it. EAT IT!""
To be completely honest, it's hard to be vegan in this environment, but that's NO EXCUSE. I'm a failure.

During the afternoon we text and he asks if he can have Christmas Dinner in my house with me. I say: ""Sure. But I'm vegan, so don't expect a dead pig seazoned with garlic and onion resting inside my oven (joking but really serious)

 His answer: ""Sure. Not a problem. I can eat meat at my grandmas and right after I drive to you"". 


He didn't came cause I didn't text back. We don't speak anymore and we never had a date. After that time I figured that we don't much in common too. 

Is not that I am a bad person, I just feel bad to be with someone who knows the reasons for my political act and still makes fun of it as if it's not a big deal to kill to eat. 

I live in South America and I ask myself what is wrong with those men who truly believes ""meat makes them stronger, manly"" Why? Is literally a poor dead animal.

The farmer would sell him for £700. Its an ethical dilemma, though. I know buying him from the farmer is funding animal ag, but at the same time, he's going to be sold anyway! Surely it's better to be sold, and continue having a life, than be sold for meat? The farmer is aware of my intentions for buying the steer, I've told him he would be going to a sanctuary.

vegan,the lengths people will go to to eat cheese,"I went to a pizza place with a group of friends the other week which offers vegan cheese.

I really try hard to gently offer good vegan alternatives to non-vegan friends and encourage them to make replacements. But in this instance it felt like not only the moral choice, but also the LOGICAL choice.
So I snapped a little and said they literally make vegan pizzas here, guys, you don't have to eat cheese. And I got some mildly awkward laughs and no real response as they ordered their cheese pizzas anyways.

Afterwards one of my friends had such bad stomach cramps after the cheese, everyone was smothering her and trying to make sure she's ok, I couldn't help but just feel no compassion whatsoever."

I mean even if she’s plant based she should know that from other restaurants. So kind of shocking. Anyway she plays dumb and is like thanks for letting me know blah blah blah I’ll change it to agave. Then she says she’s been vegan for ten years how did she not know that. I couldn’t help myself and I was just like your not vegan you went fishing and she’s like I did catch and release (which is likely a lie) and I was just like oh well vegans don’t go fishing it’s an ethical thing and she’s like some people do it for health then I just left bc I felt so awkward about the entire encounter.

vegan,The film Lamb (2021) and Veganism [massive spoilers],"I just finished watching the film Lamb and I wanted to share my thoughts on how it related, heavily in my opinion, to Veganism.

I've already said in the title, but massive spoilers lie ahead. If you want to watch this film, do not read anything I'm about to say. Go in blind. It's a fantastic film.

.
.
.
.

Lamb is a film about a farmer couple in Iceland. The film mostly concentrates on their sheep, showing how they care for the sheep, feed the sheep, birth lambs and, at one point, eat them.

One sheep gives birth to a lamb. The couple look at each other in shock, and they care of it like a baby human, holding it, hugging it, putting it in a crib.

It turns out, about halfway through the film, that it is in fact half human. It's a hybrid with a sheep head, one sheep... arm? And a human arm and legs. They care for it like their daughter, naming it after their deceased daughter, Ada, and it grows and acts like a normal human, except it can't talk.

Ada starts questioning her existence and whether she is a sheep or a human and, at the end of the film, a sheep-human hybrid grabs a gun and kills the male farmer. (Yay!)

.

Here are my thoughts on this in relation to Veganism: The humans suffered a loss of their own child and, upon seeing this newborn hybrid, stole the child to make themselves feel better. She steals the child because she thinks that she, because she is human, is more important.

The sheep who birthed Ada shows massive amounts of grief, standing and baaing under the window where Ada sleeps. This annoys the farmer who, after the sheep follows them around, trying to reclaim Ada, shoots the sheep in the head, killing her.

To me, this is a great representation of how humans will kill animals without hesitation to make ourselves feel better. We will steal babies away from mothers and even kill the mothers just for our own selfish need.

The original Ada, the farmer's daughter, was ""taken"" from them when she died. And so, to make herself feel happier, she literally takes the lamb away from her mother, ignoring the cries and grief of the animal, the same as which she experienced when she lost her daughter.

This happens so often in the farming world. We take away calves to take the mother's milk. We take baby chickens, pigs, cows, sheep, and every animal under the sun for reasons like: eating them, drinking their milk, entertainment such as zoos, or to keep them as pets.

Since I have been eating a complete plant based diet (no meat, dairy, egss), it is easier for me to look into vegan ideologies more because I don't feel the same guilt as I did before. I am close to being vegan for health reasons AND animal rights reasons. Eating meat at this point would not just feel unhealthy to me but it would feel wrong as well.

However, I wonder about your opinions on pest control. It is said that not having pest control can be damaging to your house and it can have negative health effects. Is using pest control services a bad thing? If so do you implement any alternatives?"

Because of this, though, I’m at a loss as to what to do about all the ants infesting my room. I don’t want them crawling all over my stuff, but I also don’t want to harm them. What do I do?"
vegan,my mom hates the fact of me “trying” to be vegan,"i’ve been vegetarian for around 5 years and mostly never accepted eating anything that comes from animals. this year i’m substituting literally everything i can for plant based. and this idea kills my mom! she says she’s okay with me being vegetarian, but being vegan is a big no. i’ve literally proved and showed her every single valid argument for why veganism is so important. and she listens and says if she had someone cooking for her she would become vegan. i tried to prove her so many times it’s not as hard as she thinks and i’m pretty sure what scares her the most is the word vegan. today when we were at the grocery store and i was buying vegan cheese she literally freaked out and said her daughter will not be vegan.

I’ve read that eating meat can fix this. I’ve been a vegan for like 2 years but like to call it plant based as I don’t like getting bullied by the boys at work. I’d like to call it quits as I feel like less masculine and I dunno if it’s like testosterone I’m not getting from the steroid injected kangaroo AKA I’m part aboriginal so it’s okay. I hear a lot of vegans and stuff wanting to be all natural and healthy what your thoughts on vitamins? I feel like those Flannery’s are getting taken over by chemists like in the middle of my street, but seriously what happened to the natural remedies. The governments want us to eat pills instead being healthy. What are your thoughts sick of the violent hangovers from no iron, b12, zinc.

vegan,Vegan discount online stores or US Vegan Snack Only Subscription Box (1 off purchase),"Hi,

Can anyone recommend one, can't find any price comparisons on **snack only boxes in the US** ,this is for a gift so price per month for a year doesn't help me,a discount code would be great as am on a budget &amp; I would only be making the 1 purchase (around $15) ... I'd like to get a giftcard so the person can choose ,or can create an account &amp; give them the log in details (with a disposable card).

Preferably healthy snacks with a wide choice selection.

Or any alternatives,like buying on Amazon,but I guess that may be more expensive,I'm not sure. Even basic information on this would probably be helpful as I've never done this &amp; don't live in the US...

Alternatively... If these online food stores exist in the US I'd love to know what they are called as Googling hasn't given me any answers,In the UK here is what they are described as:

*Approved Food is a member of the Approved Group. Approved Food offers the UK's best selection of clearance food &amp; drink at discount prices*

*CLEARANCE XL® is an online retailer of clearance approved  food and drink and household items . Shop online now and buy cheap cut  price in date, out of date and short coded food and drink as featured on  TV. As well as discounted pet food and discounted value for money  branded household essentials.*

vegan,what do you guys think about the carnivore diet?,"This isn't a troll question lol I just want you guys' opinion nutrition wise. I know ethically and environmentally it's a horrible horrible thing to do which is why I'm plant based too. But I was bored and started watching YouTube videos and came across Jordon Petersen and his daughter Mikhail Petersen who follow a complete carnivore diet.
That means they only eat meat, salt and water.

I just cannot possibly imagine how in the world a diet like that can be healthy. I myself find it hard to check all the boxes when I'm following the daily dozen diet to get all the essential nutrients. How can someone soley rely on meat forever?

And apparently it cured her arthritis and depression?
This is something that comes up quite often when I try to talk about veganism. People want to follow the no carb keto diet and show stuff like this to say that eating meat is better.

Are there any studies on this?
I would be introduced to see studies from both sides. Like how the hell can a carnivore diet be sustainable lol I need to understand it"
vegan,Figuring out what foods are vegan.,"Is there an app for certain ingredients or a useful website for this? I’m increasingly finding out weird ingredients I’d assume weren’t even naturally found are actually made with animal protein. Is there a faster way to do this other than googling every ingredient? 

Also, there are many things that claim to be vegan or are said to “most likely” be vegan but then articles will be out there saying “well I’d look out for x y and z but who knows”. It’s very confusing, do you guys even eat pre packaged food that doesn’t explicitly say vegan for this reason? How should that be approached?

vegan,"Need help, 6 month trying to go vegan with a lot of mistakes.","Hi people. I’m writing my first post on reddit because I need some genuine help and do not have a community of support or guidance anywhere else. Hoping to receive some help here. 

So, I went vegan 6 months ago. Before that, I was a vegetarian who avoided dairy when possible. It was more for health reasons earlier, but after educating myself more on animal cruelty and how much damage I was causing the world and the animals. I decided to go vegan for ethical reasons. 

I’m from India so it’s fairly easy to go vegan here. I would also say I’m privileged enough to afford sources like tofu, plant based milk, on a regular basis to balance my diet out. By now you’re probably thinking girlie just come to the point. So I’ll. I’m just scared to come off as a hypocrite for committing a few mistakes after being aware of the brutal reality of dairy cows. Though I completely recognise that if I have done something intentionally that’s not a mistake but a clear choice I’ve decided to make. 

In the past 6 months. I’ve tried my best to turn vegan, so cutting out every single dairy product (have never ate meat, vegetarian trying to turn vegan, like i said). I’ve failed to sometimes completely avoid it, like the other day I had Maggi which may contain traces of milk. Or I had frozen dumplings which had cheese in them. Or when I eat some chips without knowing they contain milk solids. 

I just feel very guilty and ashamed to have done this because all I had to do is read food labels properly, so essentially it’s my ignorance that has made me commit these mistakes, if that’s even the right word for it. 

It has made me lose hope and I feel I will keep committing these mistakes, especially when my cravings overpower and control my mind, a lot of things I crave had dairy in them and since I don’t have excess to a oven (required) I can’t cook those at home. (Cannot afford vegan options since they’re very expensive in India and the place where I live isn’t exactly a place where anyone would even know what veganism means)

I know this sounds like another ignorant wanna be vegan crying about her cravings and intentionally committing mistakes. But trust me, I don’t want to be that. I would appreciate any advice. Please try to be kind. It would mean a lot to me. Thank you in advance."

vegan,Do you think it's fair to review a restaurant poorly for having terrible vegan options?,"I'm more just asking a philosophical question than for practical advice.

Ignoring moral and environmental implications of an entire restaurant sourced from animal products, I'd think offering vegan options just makes good business sense. It's 2022, that's a lot of money left on the table and I wonder if owners simply aren't clued in.

Do you think it's fair for me, someone who's clearly not the target demo of a omni restaurant, to leave a poor review because they still won't accommodate?

vegan,Am I vegan?,"TL;DR: Due to health continuously declining after 7 dedicated years vegan and exhausting all vegan treatments options, I reintroduced ethically sourced eggs and sustainable seafood (mostly mollusks/bivalves); only two meals a week max. Am I still vegan?

I’m aware this might be a controversial post and I’m open to hearing your opinions because I’m genuinely curious of what different perspectives will think. &amp; Feel free to ask any questions! :)

A summary of my experience:
I was an extremely strict vegan for 7 years and vegetarian (more specifically pescatarian) for 8 years prior. So it’s been at least 15 years that I have intentionally refused to actively participate in the consumption of innocent, sentient beings. Early on it was difficult because none of my family ever entertained that lifestyle otherwise I would’ve adapted sooner but unfortunately I had to wait until I learned to prepare my own meals (about 10).

I went completely vegan after I was educated about nutrition, health and human anatomy; I investigated further, came across Earthings and was vegan immediately. That was an easy transition because it’s something I also would’ve done sooner but I wasn’t aware of all that information to make the educated decision to do so. 

I felt amazing for 3 months, unfortunately that’s when I started to get hives every single day. The hives would cover my entire body top to bottom, inside and out (multiple time a month it would get so intense it would cover my throat and vocal cords and I wouldn’t be able to speak; I was so terrified it would eventually block my airway completely). At first I assumed it was a food allergy so I did elimination diets and allergy tests with no success. The symptoms continued to worsen and none of the medical specialists had a diagnosis or treatment but most of them would say “you need to eat meat” without any explanation so I ignored the advice and spent years trying to find a vegan resolution.

With my condition worsening I knew I had a limited amount of time to reverse my symptoms and with no success using vegan options I decided to do more research desperately seeking for a vegan solution but more open minded due to the urgency. This took me down a rabbit hole that ultimately lead me to questioning the sustainability of health on a long term vegan diet (especially one without the luxuries of expensive supplements or eating massive portions all day long attempting to meet caloric and nutrient needs). Also, with the statistic of ‘84% of vegans and vegetarians return to eating meat’ it was no wonder why it is so much easier to find information on ‘why I quit veganism’ opposed to ‘why I’m still vegan after 10+ years’. 

After sifting through mountains of information, I decided to take the doctors advice. I was extremely hesitant to try animal products after so many years but I knew if I didn’t prioritize my health over ethics then I would die before 30. I still want to cause the least amount of harm as possible and choose the most environmentally sustainable options to protect our ecosystem so the only the only things I’ve introduced so far is ethically sourced eggs and sustainable seafood (mostly mollusks, some crustaceans and few wild caught fatty fish like sardines and salmon) only two meals a week max; aside from that I’m 100% plant based.

It’s only been 2 months but my symptoms have already improved tremendously! Even the brain fog I never knew I had lifted. I didn’t have a single negative reaction, it genuinely feels that’s is exactly what my body has been needed for so long. I’m assuming I was deprived of nutrients but I’m not sure which one(s).

I still practice cruelty free philosophies and would never support factory farming or any form of unnecessary abuse. If I knew of a vegan alternative to satisfy my body’s needs that are found in the seafood and eggs then I would happily substitute it. Until then I am eternally grateful for every sacrifice that is made from my consumption.

So be honest,
Am I vegan?
&amp; why?
If not, is this something I need to “come out” to my vegan friends about?"
vegan,Biggest changes in my body since going vegan (5 yrs),"I'm going on 5 years vegan and I have noticed changes in my body. The most noticeable changes for me are:

1. Better blood flow: No more cold feet in bed. Boners lol.

2. Pooping is way better:

Before vegan - I poop once per week. It takes 20-40 mins. My body does not want to poop away from home.

After vegan - I poop daily. It takes 1-5 mins. My body doesn't care about when or where I poop.


Call me crazy, but I think switching to veganism made my body switch from hunter mode (be paranoid about pooping to not alert prey) to gatherer mode (poop anywhere who cares lmao)."
vegan,This is going to get hate but...,"Many of the people on this subreddit are psycho.  


A turning point for me was seeing a post the other day of someone speaking about how when any person dies it can be celebrated as a good day for the animals given the person was not vegan. Even more disappointing was seeing much of the comment section more or less agreeing with this sentiment. 

A lot of you in this subreddit say something along the lines of... if someone has been informed on the atrocities of the meat/animal product industry, they have a moral obligation to be vegan or else they are a shit person you do not want to be associated with. That's just not how it works. For example, let's picture person of interest (POI) who works 2 jobs to barely scrape by in supporting an entire family, and is living in poverty. Now, don't come at me talking about how vegan diets when done correctly are actually much *cheaper*; I am aware of that, thank you. Anyway, POI has a LOT on their plate. Let's assume that includes juggling two full-time jobs and raising children who are often looked after by grandparent(s), who is/are also supported by POI. POI is going from one lengthy shift to another at Job #2 and has some time between to eat lunch, and the only easy, quick, and financially feasible option they can think of is to get a hamburger from McDonald's... I'm not going to shame that person EVER. You need to stop making the kinds of generalizations that you do. 

Also, I'll say that many of y'all don't actually seem to care about the animals as much as being morally superior and holier than thou. This is shown by the fact you don't see how BACKWARDS it is to criticize a company that produces plant-based foods for marketing the idea that there is no problem with their consumers also enjoying meat at other times. You people are not dumb; you understand that non-vegan consumers who get a hold of your criticisms are going to be pissed off and think: ""f\*ck it, I'm not trying ANYTHING from Alpha foods because these vegans are annoying asl and find something wrong with everything."" That's more meat eaten by that person, and the encouragement of more animals suffering as a result. You all need a reality check and to take several seats. It is honestly very embarrassing. This subreddit really does give the energy of WHITE LIBERALS IN VERMONT who preach all of the leftist *ideals* but love/ realistically wouldn't give up their lives of racial and socioeconomic homogeneity. UGH."
vegan,Silk tastes weird now,"I finally switched from vegetarian to vegan last June. I've had a few weak moments, eating eggs from neighbours' chickens a couple times, but otherwise I've done well my first year.

What's really helped is Silk, because I was a big milk drinker most of my life. The problem is I'm also very sensitive to taste, maybe a super taster, so I had to wane myself off gradually and I spent a few months before last June drinking Silk mixed with regular milk. Anyway I've been doing good, and I especially like the new Nextmilk. But I fear something terrible has happened.

The last 2 half gallons of each Nextmilk and unsweetened Silk I've had have been terrible. The regular Silk still tastes milky but it also tastes like leaves, like I can taste individual plant components. And the Nextmilk tastes like I'm drinking milk out of a horse's feeding trough, just an overwhelming oat and hay flavour.

In the off chance that any knows this restaurant, does anyone know how to make those appetizer spare ribs? Picture: [https://imgur.com/a/6OWOWio](https://imgur.com/a/6OWOWio)

vegan,"[17F] I want to go vegan for the environment, the animals, and my health. Help make me a grocery list.","I have been vegetarian for a few years now and I don’t regret it. But my cholesterol is high and I’m a tad over weight. I originally went vegetarian because of the animals and I hate steak/any meat. I think I would truly benefit from a vegan lifestyle.. I need help though.. I want to go to the store in an hour or so and start making these changes asap. I was wondering if this sub could give me advice/help with a shopping list. I love tofu, but don’t know how to make it as good as it is at restaurants. I need good tofu recipes. I also just want to have vegan alternatives around my house for snack and sweets. I’m a snacker and I love sweets. I want to cut sugar out of my diet though because I am starting to face health issues regarding the sugar I eat everyday. Sorry for making this so long, but perhaps someone here could help me decide what to get from the store/ easy recipes ti support my new eating choices. Thank you!"
vegan,A reminder of why the term Plant-Based exists.,"Today I was eating a chickpea-tempeh salad that I threw together for lunch and the local bloodmobile was nearby, so I took it in with me, hoping to squeeze in the donation during my break.

The phlebotomist noticed my lunch and said that she had previously been on a raw vegan diet herself for a whole year and was hoping to get back into it. Encouraged to see someone else positive on the idea of veganism, I encouraged her and shared some of my own tricks for food.

She mentioned that she'd also been running around a lake each morning, but there was always a bad stench from all the ducks. The other phlebotomist jumped in and we were talking about how there's an excess of ducks in the area, and then the previously 'vegan' phlebotomist utterly shocked me.

She said she had intentionally hit one of the ducks with her car and couldn't believe that a stranger got mad, took a picture of her license plate, and even put a jacket over the duck's body. 
""It's just a dumb duck."" Was her follow-up.

I was still trying to process how she could be so uncaring, but the other phlebotomist carried on with the conversation like it was no big deal. Next she mentioned how she's not going to bother waiting for animals to cross and the other saying it's better to hit them than to swerve.

This is the sort of difference that exists between people who are plant based, and those who are vegan. People that don't care about animals, but eat plants for environmental or health reasons are still perfectly capable of treating animal lives as practically worthless. This lady decided that the duck's life wasn't even worth the minute it would take just to let it cross the road."
vegan,Are pens made from feathers vegan?," So I have a question

I found a goose's flight feather on the ground and took it home, of course there is no suffering involved for them to shed their flight feathers this time of year. If I were to use it to build a pen, would it be Vegan/ethical or is that still a no-no?

Feel free to discuss, I'm unsure about it."
vegan,An Unnecessary Interjection....,"I work in a grocery store and I noticed a customer was buying a lot of plant based products and I started talking to them about recipes and products. The woman in line behind was looking at us annoyed and all of a sudden interjected ""Why don't you both just go out and gnaw on some grass?"" All dripping with sarcasm.... I then had to ring up her order which was almost entirely steak and ribs and bacon and cheese and chicken.... I barely talked to her and I'm normally a very chatty person, but that was rude and unnecessary..."

vegan,Question about the steamed veggies from the Chinese takeout restaurants in the US.,"I don’t eat out often and if I do it’s at vegan restaurants most of the time. However, on very rare occasions there was not much choice so I’ve ordered steamed veggies with plain rice (sometimes with plain steamed tofu added) from those most basic Chinese takeaway restaurants - it’s usually called “Steamed mixed vegetables”. A number of times I thought the veggies tasted a bit funny, as if they had meat broth poured over them or something. I’ve asked at multiple restaurants if they put any broth or butter etc but they all claimed it’s just veggies. Usually at those places there’s no one who speaks English well so I’m not sure how much I trust that claim when it’s hard to have my question understood. So my question to the vegan folks in the US is this - is the Steamed Mixed Vegetables dish at the Chinese takeout places vegan? Has anyone worked at these places or has more insight and can confirm? Also, are there any other dishes that are vegan or can ve veganized at those places?"
vegan,I live in a country where the public torture and murder of an animal is labelled as culture and praised by authorities,"I live in Spain.
To me, it's incredibly disgusting that the king (yeah, something from the middle ages we haven't get rid of... Yet) is used to attend that public massacre, where bullfighters are called 'masters', where followers of this culture of death chant ""vivan los toros"" (""long life to the bulls"") and where a huge chunk of the attendants are devout Catholics (where is the fifth commandant?).

Oh, and there a small chapel in every bull ring where the bullfighter prays and asks the saints to protect him.

Luckily it's popularity dwindles every year, but everything that surrounds this ""national fest"" is incredibly hypocritical that I cannot stand with it. And I have to close my mouth, lest I'm called disrispectful."

vegan,What non-vegan foods do you think could be replaced with vegan versions and most people wouldn't notice?,"I'll start.

*Most baked goods and sweets. Cookies, cakes, donuts, muffins, bagels, croissants etc. I think even some vegan ice creams could really fool most folks nowadays.    

*Protein powders. At least from a taste perspective, they taste exactly the same as non-vegan protein powders. 

*Some vegan chicken nuggets and vegan fried chicken. I've tasted a few brands now where I have to double check the ingredients because the texture is so similar to what I remember chicken being. 

*Vegan hot dogs. I think this is one of the first foods that vegans/vegetarians really nailed. 

*Vegan mayonnaise. I doubt many would notice this one. 

*Some vegan eggs. Especially the ones that are made into a patty. I honestly think most couldn't tell the difference."

vegan,"The tale of the banana cookies, and how I’ve trapped myself","Oh, r/vegan - have you ever been there - someone makes a vegan dish just for you, only it contains an ingredient you just don’t like, so you eat it anyway? 

Well, here’s my story.

Last fall, my bf and I went to a party for a religious holiday - not a major holiday but a nice reason to get together and celebrate. A mutual friend, H, was there. Neither bf nor myself are very close to H, but we both enjoy his company and he’s always been one to make sure everyone feels included. 

H brought some cookies to the party, which everyone raved about. He asked if I wanted to try, and I politely declined and explained that I was vegan. He apologized that I couldn’t enjoy, and said he’d make something vegan next time.

A month later, there is another party, and H came up to me a few minutes after my bf and I arrived to tell me he’d made two batches of cookies this time: one vegan, one “regular.” I thanked him and told him how much I appreciated it. He told me it was pretty easy to swap out the eggs - he just used mashed banana.

I panicked inside for a second - I haaaate bananas. Like, in any form. I just cannot choke down anything with bananas, even if there’s just a small portion. 

I smiled and said I was so excited to try one. And so a few minutes later, I did. And... look, if you liked bananas or even felt neutral about them, you would love these cookies. But I just could not get past the taste. 

That being said, I wanted to show H how much I appreciated that he made vegan cookies so I could try them, so I told him I loved the cookie.

A few months pass, and this weekend bf and I threw a party for MDW. We invited H, and when he arrived, he handed us a tupperware full of the cookies - since he remembered I loved them so much last time! He then proceeded to tell the group that it’s his grandma’s recipe and how happy he is to be able to share it with friends.

Well, I think I’m a little bit trapped now. I do not like bananas, I probably never will, but I also value my friendship with H and if that means eating a cookie I don’t like that he’s so proud to share every couple of months- that’s okay. I’ll eat the cookie. 

I’m sure I’m not the only one who has eaten a vegan dish with an ingredient they don’t like, because someone made it special just for them. I’d love to hear your stories."
vegan,My quest to find the best tasting vegan protein powder,"Vegan lifters, let’s be honest: we’re chugging protein shakes for their anabolic effect, not because they taste great. Some of them do taste great, but I find them to be more the exception than the rule.

So I’ve tried just about every vegan protein on the market. And here is my subjective list of their flavor profiles, from MOST noticeable flavor (bad) to LEAST flavor (good):

**Pea protein**: I find it really hard to mask this stuff. Caramel/pumpkin spice sort of works, but you can usually tell when you’re drinking pea protein. That’s not a good thing.

**Soy protein**: Not as obnoxious tasting as pea protein, but it’s chalkiness leaves something to be desired. 

**Hemp protein**: This is where things turn a corner. You can definitely taste hemp protein, but it’s manageable. For an added level of neutrality, look for hemp heart protein. It’s powdery white and is much more neutral than pea or soy.

**Peanut protein**: OK, so you definitely taste this, but the taste is so pleasant that it deserves a spot near the top of the list. If you’re a fan of peanut, you can safely add as much of this stuff as you want and it’ll never taste icky at all. 

But recently, I’ve discovered my absolute favorite vegan protein powder…

*Pumpkin seed protein**: You can barely taste this stuff. Like at all. Most protein powders start to taste a bit obnoxious after adding 30g or so to your shake. Not this. I’m easily adding 15-20g of protein to my shakes without any noticeable change in flavor. Game changer.

What do you guys think? I’ve found that a key to improving my fitness goals is finding protein shakes I’m actually happy to drink, and finding neutral flavors has been essential to creating those recipes. 

It’s tough to reach the recommended 0.8-1.0g of protein per pound of body weight benchmark on a vegan diet. Hopefully this will help!"
vegan,Question about honey bees,"So I’m seeing a lot of posts saying that honey bees are an invasive species and give things like diseases to native bees, I was a bit confused with how it was worded, since it seemed to say that the honey bees life is less valuable. so is the hope that one day the honey bees will be gone? Or are we supposed to be trying to help both kinds of bees? Sorry if this question is silly"
vegan,What's your experience with B12 supplements and pimples?,"I'm rather new to this whole vegan thing (2 months) and got a question on the effect vitamin B12 supplements seem to have on my skin.

When i started being vegan i didnt supplement for the first month because i figured i still had enough B12 from my previous omnivore diet. Here my skin was the best i ever had in my life.

Then i started taking 300 micro gramms (one pill) of Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) daily. The pimples came back. Not terrible akne but 2,3 pimples every other day. 

This made me curious and i stopped taking the supplement for 3 days. Pimples vanished. Amazing skin again.

Now i read that taking too much vitamin B12 can produce pimples and even lead to akne but on the other hand i'm still paranoid of not taking enough.

So how much B12 is enough and how much is too much? Do you have experience with other forms of taking B12? Anyone found a solution for the pimple problem?"
vegan,Good mushroom-free coffee alternative?,"I’ve been drinking Four Sigmatic adaptogenic mushroom coffee for the past year, and just found out I’m highly sensitive to mushrooms… yay. Anyone know of a good mushroom-free coffee alternative?

For some context, regular coffee gives me the jitters really bad and I love how the adaptogens in the Four Sigmatic make me feel. Relaxed but awake and focused. I also love the flavor and ritual of coffee in the morning.

If there are no other options I guess I’d do regular decaf coffee but that’s no fun."

Honestly this is very judgmental. I have no need to impose my lifestyle to my partner, and I don’t think we have incompatible lifestyles. And this way I got her to enjoy non animal protein sources (tofu, legumes, powdered…) and to ask me to cook them for her.

vegan,Memorial Day Success,"In my family, memorial Day weekend is our annual reunion. We see each other at other times of the year too, but this is the weekend everyone keeps clear so we can all be together for a few days on a beautiful lake. It's always been my favorite time and something i look forward to all year. This year I was a bit apprehensive about it because food is a big part of the experience and this was my first time seeing my family, including my parents and siblings, since I went vegan. I knew there was going to be a lot of animal bodies and products being consumed. I knew that I wasn't going to be able participate in sharing food the way I used to. I was afraid of being judged and having to defend my choice, having animal products pushed on me or flaunted in front of me. I was even afraid that being around so much carnism would make me judgemental and critical of my family.

I was so pleasantly surprised! One of my aunts cooked a completely vegan shepherd's pie and lots of people tried and enjoyed the lentil curry I made. Multiple people remarked how healthy I looked and most were very encouraging and supportive of my veganism. I didn't have many judgemental thoughts, and those I did I kept to myself. The only time I talked about veganism was when I was directly questioned about it. One of these discussions didn't go well because the person who brought it up was pretty drunk and kept interrupting and talking over me when I tried to answer their questions, but I just walked away when I realized the conversation wasn't going anywhere. Afterwards, I overheard my brother and some cousins defend my position and say such flattering things about my intellect and altruism that I actually cried.

I went to lunch with my parents before I had to go to the airport to fly ""home"" and they happily agreed to try a vegan restaurant. Both of their meals included tempeh and they absolutely loved it, my mom said she's going to look for it next time she goes grocery shopping. Today, my dad even called to tell me that he chose vegan jerky over turkey jerky and that it was pretty good! 


I'm so happy! I don't know if anyone else in my family will actually end up going vegan, but just the fact that most of them accepted and even praised my choice to be vegan was gratifying. I feel very lucky to have had this experience, I know most people probably have a much harder time with getting their loved ones on board."

vegan,Supporting younger vegans,"I feel like we have to figure out how to support our younger vegan friends to a stage where they feel more secure and are not being guilted out about their veganism by the adults in their lives. Not sure how to do it other than supporting those who share or vent here. 
I see questions all the time from teens or young adults about situations where they were made to feel bad or awkward about being vegan. We’ve all been there and I still feel bad in som situations. 
But I’m old enough and have my life together enough where I can remove myself from certain situations if I don’t want to be a part of it anymore. And no one can do anything about that. 
For instance, I went to a work dinner last year. It was a carnist place ofc and they said they could make a plant based seitan dish for me. I ordered it and it came covered in dairy cheese shavings. I didn’t touch it. But everyone else at the table turned their nose up at the seitan. I found myself in that very uncomfortable position of defending a dish I didn’t even like, that was made by one of their non creative carnist chefs! I but my tongue that night and laughed it off but I’ve turned down every invitation since and now I don’t get them. I’m happy. 
When people visit me, I ensure anything they bring over is fully vegan. I’ve been vegan long enough and am old enough now where I have learned to be diplomatic about it. My friends and colleagues even know to check on barnivore if they even bring over wine. 
I feel for the youngsters who find themselves unable to speak up like that. It comes with age, and I wish we could support them in the meantime. 
Anyway if anyone else has anything to add/say, please share. 
These young vegans are going to be the ones to make a big difference to us and likely (hopefully) save this planet. Like the OG vegans paved the way for us starting 2-3 decades ago, we must do the same for these fine youngsters."

Anyways, I’m constantly getting acid reflux, heart burn, nausea etc (have been for many many many years) and so I know a dietary change is in order to ensure I’ve covered by lifestyle bases before seeking medical care (beyond the here take this PPI prognosis).

vegan,I'm fed up with my local grocery store,"They treat their vegan products carelessly. I'm talking rips in yogurt cup lids, a literal layer of ice growing over the ice cream, veggie burgers, frozen vegan stuff in general, to where you can't even read the label, boxed vegan products smashed or slightly opened from careless handling, it's a mess. And the worst part is that all the carnist foods are in pristine condition. Their frozen meals or ice cream or whatever have 0 visible ice crystals on them, their yogurt isn't ripped open and their boxes aren't smashed. Usually with the other stuff I can filter through the damaged ones and make it work (i dont care much about smashed boxes if the box didnt open in the process), but I just really want some veggie burgers or ice cream and it's not possible, since a thick layer of ice like that most of the time indicates that it thawed and refroze and I just don't trust that it's not spoiled. Why??? Why are they so mean to the vegan products???? The next closest grocery store is an hour drive away and I'm not doing all that. Sigh. 

Does this happen anywhere else or just my little shithole town??? I don't mean that, my town is actually great for the most part i like it here, I'm just upset because my family has gone out for ice cream or milkshakes every day this week and come home doing this over exaggerated thing about how wonderful it is (yay cruelty in a cup!

Because I personally would be hyping a guy up if he was getting free drinks from girls. Like, are they mad they don't get hit on as much? Because it's not a woman's fault that they get hit on more than men, men for years and years had to be our providers because as women we didn't even have RIGHTS to support ourselves and now that we do you guys just get mad that we STILL get free drinks? can someone explain it to me am I just being a bitch or do I have even a small point to be made?

vegan,My girlfriend rejects veganism,"My girlfriend believes even being vegetarian is difficult, and she's vegetarian because of allergies. When she lived with me for a while (had to go home to her home-country) she tried veganism, but every time she cut out the fish and the eggs and didn't use a replacement at all, so she'd make some bare-bones macaronies without any other source of protein etc. 

I did give her advice and tell her to make more protein filled food, but she didn't really like thinking about that and just made tasty food without much nutrition in it. I even offered to make her food but she didn't eat it.

After a while she started talking about her bones going soft and her not producing blood bla bla bla, and then she says she doesn't believe in veganism anymore. 

It's like of course you're not producing blood and your bones are going soft, you're thinking more about taste than nutrition."
vegan,Easy Vegan Alternative to Chicken?,"Hi all!

I am having a dinner party tonight and a good friend who is coming over is vegan/gluten free. I'm doing a pretty simple chicken and rice recipe and want to provide a vegan alternative for her and anyone else who might want it.

I was thinking about using Soy Curls as I'm pretty terrible with classic tofu, but wanted to know if these are pretty easy to cook. I don't want to mess it up and leave them just eating rice and salad! I'm going to be grabbing chickpeas and some assorted vegetables as a backup plan, but thought I'd see if anyone had a recommendation I may not have thought of? 

Thanks so much in advance - I really appreciate any good advice on this!"
vegan,How do you cope with it?,"There is a farm near my house. I think 200+ animals (cows, horses and donkeys mostly). The owner is an old man (75/80 yo), he got covid last year and his wife died (of cancer). He's been unwell or in the hospital or anyway unable to take care of the place and animals. The place is a disaster. It's hard to describe, sort of unbelievable. Just crazy. Everything was so wrong (he is the kind of guy who think keeping a dog on a chain his whole life is okay or who just beats animals up. To be clear). Some (most) days the animals didn't have food/water/ a lot were unwell. This happened in December. Since then my mom (also vegan and a vet btw) and some friends have started to feed the animals and check on them while he was gone and also once he was back (still doing it now). 
Fast forward to now and the real point of my post. He's now trying / being forced by local authorities to close everything up and sell the animals, or everything will be seized. So he is selling the animals. My mum and her friends have been trying super hard to find people who wants to adopt some of them, and succeeded for some horses. So some of them will be fine and that's amazing and a relief. All cows and half+ of the horses will eventually end up to the slaughterhouse. 
My mum etc have been going there at least twice every day since December, and I've been going every time i was free and not in university etc. I'm not saying i know and love every single one of those animals. 
But there are some, who maybe were sick and needed special treatment, the new borns who are especially domesticated, some who just sticked with you, whom i now love as if they were my own dog (to use a common metaphor). I know most of them now and every single one has their own personality. Some are very open, some are more reluctant and don't trust humans. They are so smart and curious. 
I was aware this would happen, they are so many and i can't save them all. But it's breaking my heart. How do i cope with this? It's been all i could think about for the past few days, and I'm constantly on the verge of tears (and have cried tbh). Some animals were so reluctant and scared at first, and now they are so much more open and curious about us. You can see they are curious about you but still unsure if they can trust you. Some decided they can and prove it everyday by coming closer or licking your hand or sniffing you a bit. I feel like I'm betraying them. 
Sorry for the long post, this is especially ranty so i hope it makes some sense"
vegan,Does anyone else feel like being vegan is treated like a crime at regular restaurants?,"I was out to eat and simply asked the waiter if there was any dairy in a salad dressing. He asked me in return, ""are you lactose intolerant?"" I said no... I'm vegan. It sort of bothered me though, like should it matter why I'm asking? He came back with a written out page with all the ingredients and an attitude that I was really picky. I just wanted a simple answer. 

I also found it funny that when ordering the salad, he asked if I wanted to add ""a protien."" I don't think this is rude or anything, I just think it shows how people are so brainwashed into equating meat with the only way of getting protien."
vegan,Why do I feel like such an outlier?,"I’ve been vegan for almost 3 years! I live in the U.S. and recently went on a trip to Chicago with some friends! In general, it wasn’t bad! Chicago has very good vegan restaurants, but I ate at them all alone because no one wanted to come with me to them. I’m 24 and I quit drinking alcohol almost 2 years, an amazing victory in my eyes but my friends drank heavily every night and I just kinda sat there trying my best to be engaged, but still with a feeling of being left out in the back of my mind.

I’m 24, I don’t drink or do any drugs, vegan, and live in a rural area. What the heck do I do and how do I actually socialize with friends? Some of the biggest bonding experiences can be over dinner or drinking, something I find very conflicting with most people. It’s starting to make me depressed because I feel like I know what I’m doing is right but there’s these stigmas in the U.S. to do the exact opposite, and if you don’t then you’re weird. Does anyone feel similar?"

vegan,Promise Neverland,"Hey folks,  
There is a popular Anime called Promise Neverland . It is very much a critique on animal agriculture in a fun pop culture kind of way...  


(big spoilers)   
None of my friends seemed to get the link but the children are basically veal, being raised to be eaten. Might help give context to some less braindead friends you might have. Also quite entertaining, unfortunately my comment here is the big spoiler, whoops!   
Cheers!"
vegan,Anyone know if So Delicious sweetened vanilla coconut milk yogurt changed its recipe recently?,"I usually buy the vanilla/strawberry 8 pack from BJs, and this time around, something tastes off about the vanilla flavor. It isn't necessarily bad, but it isn't the same. It almost has a faint corn flavor to it...and it seems a little watered down? 

Just wondering if anyone else has noticed or has any insight.
Thanks!"
vegan,Hospital in Turkey,"I’m in a hospital in turkey with my mom because she’s getting cosmetic surgeries and she wants me to look after her afterwards. I’ll be stuck in this room by myself for 2 days. Someone just walked in and put a non-vegan meal on the table and left. I don’t speak the language either. I’d hate to waste food, but I also don’t want to feel bad about myself. What’s y’all’s take?"
vegan,Can someone give me any tips you wish you had when you first started?,"I had given up all red meat for the past 3 weeks due to high cholesterol. But I’ve recently heard mixed reviews on chicken messing with cholesterol as well, so I figured it would just be best to try and give up all meat. I’m hoping that won’t be too difficult since I have never been a fan of red meat, and though I do enjoy chicken, I have eaten morning star chicken Pattie’s for years (honestly, it will just be hard giving up Zaxbys and wendys chicken). 

The thing that I’m most nervous about is dairy. I LOVE creamy dressings (Caesar, ranch, etc), yogurts. and many desserts. I also love cheese, but due to the cholesterol I’ve given that up this past 3 weeks and it’s been pretty okay. 

I’ve always wanted to do this because I’m a big animal fan (which is how I was introduced to morning star, I tried for a few days and then failed). But now that my health is also in question, it’s not just a “want,” but also a “need.” 

So I just need advice on how you succeeded, and what you wish you’d done differently to make this journey an easy transition. Because I’ve tried before and failed miserably. I want this time to be a success."

I finally feel like I am developing a healthier relationship with food. I cook all the time which I love. I have fun trying and doing new recipes. I feel good about the food I eat as no one was killed or abused for it. Thank you for this community!

vegan,2 questions regarding butter and eggs,"So my coworker is vegan so I’m trying to experiment with some stuff she could eat. I was going to try an apricot Tunisian sauce that’s pretty awesome, but it contains chicken stock and butter. The chicken stock I figure I could sub out for veggie stock, but with butter I’m not so sure. For a sauce (butter added at the end, so not part of the cooking process) would olive oil be okay? Or do I need to get vegan butter? Is the taste difference in vegan butter and olive oil super noticeable?

And secondly, what perspective do y’all have regarding “ethically sourced” eggs? I have 5 pet chickens, completely free range (except when it’s too cold and I have to bring them in the house but that’s rare), kinda spoiled. My dog and I eat their eggs when they’re laying (almost no eggs in winter, but so many eggs during the spring). What is the consensus regarding using essentially waste products from the hens? I consider it akin to using their feces as fertilizer, just curious about a vegan perspective.

Thanks for reading and considering my questions, and for answering if you choose to do so!"
vegan,"Temptations, parents, and veganism","So you may have seen my last post about my struggle with empathy. However, my main other issue(s) are my parents and temptation about meat. My parents are quite so-so about veganism. My mom agreed to vegetarianism and I went veggie for a while however the temptation of a steak(or dead cow) was enough to make me quit. Unfortunately, I don’t have the power to make the household vegan and that temptation is hard to resist. I am not sure what to do. One part of me wants to go vegan but the temptation of meat is oftentimes too much. Also dont even get me started on things like yogurt and butter and things with eggs in it."

vegan,New vegan - i need some help!!,"Are there any other protein sources that aren’t tofu or beans?? I suck at making tofu unless it’s for tacos lol and i only like a select few beans but i get tired of them quickly.
Meat substitutes like stuff from morningstar farms and gardein make me nauseous sometimes and idk why!! I never was a big fan of meat in the first place, and beef/pork would often make me nauseous :(( I like the meatless chicken tenders tho 
Should i just get some vegan protein powder and drink that everyday?
Is there such a thing as a vegan greek yogurt? Like with the similar texture too?  I would love that to have with my fruit. 
My diet lately has been mostly pb&amp;j, potatoes and other carbs like bagels w/ vegan cream cheese and spaghetti and tomato sauce T-T
I sprinkle nutritional yeast on almost everything though, i hope that helps ! lol"
vegan,Im furious. Am I overreacting?,"Today we had a get together at my house. A few of my aunts came and one of them brought some brownies. She told me to try one, and when I asked her if they were vegan, she said that they were. I was shocked because shes not a vegan, but I figured she baked them special so everyone can enjoy the dessert. My aunt and I ended up having about an hour long conversation about vegan baking, foods, etc. After I ate one of her brownies she looked at me and said that she was ""just kidding"" about the brownies being vegan, and they had milk and eggs in them. I was furious. Am I overreacting or is this as messed up as I think it is?"
vegan,Mulesing is a serious issue.,"I’m a knitter and I won’t lie, wool is the nicest material to knit with. I haven’t bought wool since I went vegan thank god, but I had convinced myself that when the time came I could find an ethical source of wool (possibly a local sanctuary that had to shear sheep for comfort reasons). If you’re like me please search the term mulesing and look at the images. I saw them and cried. They are so grotesque. For those who don’t know, it’s essentially cutting away of skin around the buttocks of the sheep to prevent feces from sticking and causing flystrike. The idea is that you cut away the skin and wool can’t grow there. It’s done to babies (I believe 15 ish weeks) with no anesthetic. If you’re holding on to something please please look into it more. If profit is involved people will do anything and everything to animals."
vegan,Earthling Ed: a great comedian and business woman Help my comment out?,"Hello vegan friends

I just watched a couple little bits of a response video to one of Ed winter's videos

The channel Goatis on YouTube made a response video and near the end of that video titled ""Earthling Ed: a great comedian and business woman""- the host of the channel has a slide that seems really disingenuous, either that or the hosts could simply use more education regarding vegan nutrition.

 It's entirely possible that he may just be ignorant to other information and while I like to think that all of the information I put in my comment is accurate, I am also human and I am fallible so I will concede to any valid evidence which is contrary to my comment should it be provided.

I'm just asking if anyone willing in this community would mind going over to the video and finding my comment under the same username Gwilfawe and giving it a thumbs up for visibility.

Please do not attack or berate the YouTuber I am engaging with as I am trying to genuinely further the discussion. I do fear however that my comment may go unnoticed by the people who subscribe to his channel and I think that it would be healthy to have a good discourse around the information he provided on the slide.

Thank you 💚"
vegan,"In 2016, dairy farmers resorted to dumping 43 million gallons of milk - and as of March 31, the U.S. still has 1.4 billion pounds of cheese in cold storage","From this article: [https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/government-cheese](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/government-cheese)

""Over the years, the industry has found all sorts of ways to get rid of its excess supply—some more insidious than others. In the 1990s and early 2000s, even as U.S. nutritionists expressed growing concern about saturated fats and rising obesity levels, a marketing firm created and partially funded by the USDA gave millions to fast-food companies such as Taco Bell and Domino’s to push them to increase the amount of cheese on menu items by as much as eightfold. Buoyed by items like Wendy’s “dual Double Melt sandwich concept” and Taco Bell’s steak quesadilla, the organization helped [boost cheese sales by more than 30 million pounds](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/us/07fat.html).

While the government-owned cheese hoards of the 1970s and ‘80s are largely a thing of the past, the U.S. has still never really figured out what to do with its excess dairy. In 2016, dairy farmers resorted to simply dumping [43 million gallons of milk down the drain](https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-dairy-farmers-dump-43-million-gallons-of-excess-milk-1476284353). The same year, the USDA bought up [$20 million worth of cheese to cut the glut](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/08/24/us-to-buy-20-million-of-cheese-the-same-idiot-mistake-the-eu-used-to-make/?sh=265d8be91c0e).

And as of March 31, the U.S. still has [1.4 billion pounds of cheese in cold storage](https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/pg15bd892?locale=en)—only now it’s [owned by private companies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/28/americas-cheese-stockpile-just-hit-an-all-time-high/?noredirect=on). One particularly large pile of it resides in the former limestone quarries underneath Springfield, Missouri, where Kraft Heinz keeps a considerable cache of cheese in these temperature-controlled facilities. The Dairy Farmers of America, which has been using the facility, known as the Springfield Underground, for more than 30 years, [currently has 7 million pounds of raw product](https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/2022/05/08/springfield-cheese-cave-missouri-dairy-companies-store-7-million-pounds/6785381001/).  


Some of this is normal inventory storage or cheese being aged. Yet part of this cheese mountain represents [an enduring surplus](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jan/10/america-cheese-surplus-production-dairy-farmers)—a very literal representation of the dairy industry’s mismatch with the realties of the market.""

Someone please explain to me why this makes sense. Sometimes I hate this planet. Those poor cows..."
vegan,Does anyone know if theres a coconut free vegan ice cream,I have a coconut allergy and every vegan ice cream I find has coconut oil in it. It used to not be too bad so I would still eat it but it’s progressively getting worse and even just being near coconut alone gets me ill. I know there are coconut free nice creams but this question is targeted towards commercially sold ice creams.
vegan,hot take,"i’d you’re vegan but produce a lot of food waste &amp; produce a lot of trash, your veganism is just a social ploy. i’d rather someone not be vegan yet trying to reduce their footprint than a vegan who thinks they’re high &amp; mighty only for being vegan yet making no effort on their actual footprint past that."
vegan,Lesser of two evils…? What would you do?,"I’ve been trying to find ways to reduce our chemical/carbon foot print/use eco-friendly products and generally lead a more “natural” life. At the same time, my husband and I have started eating vegan so as we trade out our everyday products for more eco-friendly versions I also try to find vegan ones.

I really want to stop using dryer sheets, but most dryer balls are made of wool. I saw a plastic option, but that is just trading one evil for another IMO. What would you do?"
vegan,My struggle for empathy with animals,"I have long struggled to feel empathy. When a family member died of COVID I felt little sadness while my parents wept. When I was very young I was very cruel around pets which I now regret. At first I thought this was linked to a behaviour disorder called DMDD but that only really affects me when I am mad (likely the reason I was cruel around pets as a young kid). While with pets I have a bit more empathy and am not cruel to them; my mind has a hard time making the connection between what’s on my plate and the farm animals being killed or ‘exploited’ for my food. I actually went vegetarian but backed out over a steak. I have even watched dominion, but ‘logic’ took over any amount of empathy and internally I was like ‘that sucks oh well anyway when’s the chicken ready’. However I did feel upset and nearly teared up over the horses,dogs and some of the exotic animals. 

Tl;dr I feel bad about my lack if empathy for farm animals.

Context: I’m autistic and went veggie for a bit but backed out."
vegan,"What do you use nutrional yeast as a replacement for, specifically?","I bought some nutrional yeast, and I've used it as a replacement for parmesan cheese on pizza and spaghetti. But nothing else is really coming to mind for other things I could replace with this yeast.

I kinda ran it through a search engine, but everything seems kind of vague. What do you, personally, do with yeast?"
vegan,Tofu smells like very bad breath/cavities?,"I would like to start off this post by saying that I haven't yet fully transitioned into being vegan, I live somewhere where vegan options are scarce and hard to find, so I'm still trying out foods to see which work and which don't.

I went grocery shopping with my mum today and saw that the grocery store started selling tofu, I've never seen tofu in grocery stores here so I was basically jumping with joy because I had bought some when I was on vacation last year and really enjoyed it. But this time it smells so off.

My first thoughts were ""Oh my god tofu!!"" and immediately after followed by ""Shouldn't this be refrigerated?"" because it was just sitting in the middle aisle. But I a jar and took it home.

I think I counted the stars when I opened and smelled it. It didn't just smell off, it smelled horrendous, it made my mum sneeze. The best way I can describe it is the smell of an old man's mouth, who hasn't brushed his teeth in years. It's cubed and in a jar of brine, I drained it and soaked it in regular water, and the smell somewhat disappeared but there are still hints of old man when you really sniff it. It tastes fine though, only a slight after taste of breath. 

I'm just asking how normal this is and maybe is it just that I got a bad jar? Last time I had it it was smoked tofu so I don't know what regular tofu is supposed to smell like. The expiration date is in November 2022((triple checked lol)), so it's definitely not expired:/"
vegan,Do non-vegans like nutritional yeast?,"I want to cook vegan dishes for the non-vegans in my life, but a lot of my favorites use nutritional yeast. One of my friends hates the taste of the nutritional yeast specifically, another said it smells weird.

vegan,SAD VEGAN BDAY…,"Hey so it’s been awhile since I posted on here and I know what I’m about to stay isn’t the BIGGEST of issues but I just want to rant a bit since I don’t have any vegan friends irl… so no one can really understand my situation except my bf.. 

Well my bday just passed and me, my partner, my sister and parents were in bodega bay for a wedding.. not only was this wedding 7 hrs away, on my actual bday but it was also outdoors and rained and resulted in me getting sick lol (although this did upset me this wasn’t the icing on the cake)

the next day I wanted to go out to eat for my bday with my family. So my partner isn’t a vegan but eats mainly plant based, my mom and sister aren’t vegan but are willing to eat plant based foods… my dad on the other hand is a carnist and HATES vegan food and is often the one who makes jokes or says “I’m not eating that fake food” 

I have successfully gotten him to taste some vegan food I made or bought but he’ll usually just take a bite and complain he doesn’t like it or whatever..I have also secretly made our homemade chili recipe and veganize it multiple times without him knowing and he LOVED it each time.

(Granted he is a picky eating general and sticks to foods he knows he likes, and is just too scared to try new flavors)

But I thought you know since it was my bday he’d be willing to eat 1 vegan meal a year at least for my bday… but nope, me and my partner went alone and him, my mom and sister all went to a different restaurant… I legit cried in the car because for his bday he loves steak and although I hate seeing people eat dead bodies in front of me I go because it’s his bday..

Sorry this is long but I thought some details were important to add…

TLDR: my carnist dad wouldn’t eat 1 vegan meal this year for my bday…"
vegan,Being vegan is hard,"Not because I have trouble finding good vegan food, or getting all my vital nutrients. That part is relatively easy.

vegan,I can't keep up anymore.,"I understand the frustration and negative responses that this post may get but I am at my limit 


I'm depressed and struggling a lot to do even basic tasks with my life. Therapy and medication hasnt helped due to other circumstances in my life causing me problems.

I no longer have the energy to prepare food. I really don't.

I only eat food that's cheap and ready at this point, and most of it where I live (not american) is not vegan.

Not only was it reassuring that the process wasn't a waste of time but that they personally had got it right, that time at least. ;-)

As some have mentioned here, given how many issues opening up the carnist can of worms causes most people (denial / anger etc) 'sowing a seed' can work. ;-)"
vegan,I really like beans,"Non-vegan people say: ""But I like the taste of meat"".

Bro, have you ever tasted beans? They are the best food I've ever had. Beans with extra beans and then some beans on top.

Usually I add beans to that.

""But how do you get protein?"" Well, there's this thing called: Beans.

I really love them. I think I should get some more beans.

For every time a non-vegan eats meat, I'll eat some extra beans"
vegan,More variety in diet is evolutionally needed,"Today i had a 2 hours debate on a discord server with a guy that was pretty well spoken (my first vegan debate with a stranger). Even though he had some cognitive dissonance he was pretty selfaware and he was debating better than most people i see online.
One of his argument was that the exportation of plants such as avocado and the environmental problem of that as well as the effect on immigrants that farm and are exploited for those product. He basically believed that was worse than the effect of livestock.
I know data is in our favor but i couldn't convey it to him so i'd like if you showed me direct comparisons from trustworthy sources.

Now, onto his main argument.
His thesis was that there's no reason to believe our current peace and ease of life is gonna last so having the widest variety of products to chose from would be better for survival. Specifically he said that if we stopped eating meat over the generations we would develope a tolerance to it so in a situation of need we wouldn't be able to consume animals.

Even though it feels wrong i don't know how to respond to that because sure there's the possibility that we may fuck up in the future so i don't know what to say there. Also i'm not so sure up until which point that's biologically possible as dna doesn't work that way in my understanding of it.

Any counter argument please?"
vegan,"Turns out being ""pushy"" has worked in spreading veganism 😊","So, I'm someone that posts a lot of aggressively pro-vegan anti-animal ag. facebook &amp; instagram posts. You know the nonsense they all say tho, ""Nobody wants you to be that PUSHY or EXTREME vegan."" Carnists just want to feel good about themselves in their harmful habits so of course they push this toxic narrative that you need to be a ""polite"" and ""quiet"" vegan that bends over backwards to avoid confrontation. 

BUT let me tell you, it's all bullshit! This is just them trying to dodge culpability, and today was a good example of the fact that being that loud outspoken animal rights activist IS a very beneficial net positive. Someone reached out to me today and told me that they've been vegan for a month now and that my posts have helped push them in that vegan direction and keep them motivated. 

Keep being that loud outspoken fiery activist we need you to be. 🔥 It works wonders when you force that loud cognitive dissonance into the face of carnists, otherwise they are very unlikely to be confronted with it at all in their life. Happy tofu munching, beautiful people! 💚✌"
vegan,extremely simply lunches to bring to work when i’m too depressed to do any cooking?,"i’ve been defaulting to packages of instant noodles or oatmeal, neither of which are very nutritious or filling. if we have dinner leftovers i’ll bring them, but that’s pretty much the best it gets. if anyone has suggestions on cheap and very low effort meals to bring for lunch, they would be very appreciated. i don’t have enough freezer space or containers to do much meal prep."

vegan,Vegan makeup wipes for sensitive skin?,"So for context a while ago I got 2nd degree sunburn all over my arms, legs and face which became swollen and developed blisters and made me look like a half human half snake hybrid while my skin peeled off😂 My skin has healed but is way more sensitive than before and a lot of products cause irritation like burning, redness and sometimes itchiness. One product I'm having trouble with is makeup wipes, I don't wear a lot of makeup just facial sunscreen, mascara and sometimes eyeshadow. I tried Pacifica Moisture rehab rose &amp; coconut and Glowing glycolic acid orange vanilla but they caused so much burning and redness I had to wash my face twice. I also tried Yes to cucumber calming wipes for sensitive skin but even those caused burning and redness. I've tried a wet washcloth and while that works for removing sunscreen and eyeshadow it never gets the mascara completely off. Does anyone know other brands of face wipes that are cruelty free, vegan and safe for really sensitive skin?"
vegan,Rubbery avocados?,"I've had some avocados in my fridge for 15 days and cutting one open today I could barely twist it apart. It is still super firm and rubbery inside.

vegan,269 - whatever happened?,"The first few years I was vegan, 269 was a big thing and I was really into it. I helped stage a couple 269 events, discuss branding with other local vegans, and almost got branded (how I regret not doing that). Do people still use 269 as a reference for why one should be vegan?

I'd like to buy bigger noodle packs though, but those come without the spices and I can't find any spice packs sold separately from noodles either. So I'm turning to you hoping for homemade recs? I tried them with just soy sauce once and it just doesn't taste as good (at all). I'm in europe if that matters at all."

Fast forward a little over a year and I decided to end my diet due to pregnancy . 

Lately I’ve been looking into raw veganism. I really want to give it a go with the lifestyle for many reasons, but a main one being weight loss!! 

I’m curious if you counted calories as a vegan, or if you just *happened* to lose weight by eating clean .

vegan,Q: What to do with chickpeas...,"Hi all,

So I've returned to baking and I don't really use chickpeas but a few recipes use aqaufaba (chickpea 'juice') instead of eggs.

Now, obviously there's other replacements but, in principle, I don't mind using aquafaba, I just don't really eat chickpeas (not coz i don't like them, more because what I eat just doesn't have them).

I also don't have a food processor so turning them into tahini isn't really an option either. 

So, what are some options for using canned chickpeas? (I don't mind quick and easy as well as long and complicated recipes - ideally both)

Thank you!"
vegan,Working on an online campaign - would love your feedback,"Working at launching an online campaign with a website, ads, social media, and e-newsletter. 

What KINDS of resources, from your experience of deciding to become vegan yourself or what you have seen excites and convinces meat eaters to go our direction, work the best in an online setting?

Any feedback here is super appreciated as it will help me create my first anti-meat, pro-plants online campaign.

Thanks!"
vegan,Family is switching to some vegan alternatives,"So, I started switching to plant-based meals and alternative products in August 2021. My MIL was telling me that they have begun to jump on the alternative meat/diary options in their house thanks to me. My son spends time over there and he has a few favorite vegan items like chicken nuggets and ice cream. So, they have started adding more fruit, less dairy, and less meat in their diet. It’s a little change but they really enjoy the products for quality and flavor. It’s kind of my first uplifting vegan moment I suppose. Anyway, carry on!"
vegan,9months vegan looking for protein advice,"I’ve been vegan for 9 months. 
I started this journey with help of my plant based dr for 5 months, learning how to ensure a complete diet with enough fruits, veggies, carbs, cereals, whole grains, b12, etc. After these 5 months I kept this “no animal products” lifestyle with what I learned from my dr, looking always for organic and whole food options.
Lately I’ve been having a lot of questions about if I’m getting enough protein or aminos. I feel perfectly fine but anyway I feel concerned sometimes about if I could get long term side effects or sickness for the lack of protein, or how to ensure the right amount of protein, or how to combine foods to get enough protein.
Is there any valuable information u could share with me to clear out my doubts and worries?

I’m 26 yrs, 1.55m old exercise 3x a week and always been skinny, I lost 4 kg when I started this diet and now I gained 2 kg back."
vegan,What would you like to have offered at a vegan breakfast food truck?,"My wife and I love to imagine what kind of food truck we would have if we had our own business (everything would be vegan obviously). We’ve tossed around the idea of a coffee truck with vegan mills/syrups/sauces and pastries, or a breakfast food truck with burritos, bagel sandwiches, and pastries. 

Here’s what we’ve thought of so far:

-brekkie burritos with just egg and potatoes with optional sausage/bacon/ham and toppings such as cashew cream, cheese, salsa, avo, or other sauces

-bagel sandwiches with similar to the above fillings 

-basic pastries like muffins, scones or breakfast cookies 

I’m curious to know what other people would hope a vegan breakfast food truck would offer and would like some ideas! 

Happy Sunday! :)"
vegan,I kind of feel like someone is pranking me but... does anyone else feel like tofu has changed since the pandemic started?,"I feel like early on in the pandemic, first we had a tofu shortage. Both from I guess workers being sick, the general food hoarding going on, and people buying tofu who used to not because of said food shortage.

Then eventually the levels got back to normal and I didn't have to worry about getting tofu.

But ever since, my regular Whole Foods store brand and Nasoya Extra Firm tofu feels more silken. Still generally firm, but like I bought the extra firm silken tofu that Mori Nu makes.

I feel like they're using a different coagulant or something. I don't know. Maybe I'm just overanalyzing or placebo'd by my own belief it's different.

But I swear my tofu has changed."
vegan,"People love to diminish veganism as ""just a diet""","It's not just a diet, it's a moral and ethical stance. When I say animal abuse is wrong, it isn't because I think that meat has too much saturated fat or that cheese isn't good for my stomach, it's because it's animal abuse.

If someone says they love killing dogs and eating dogs or cats, they don't get to get away with that because it's their diet. 

Of course vegans care about what you eat! If thought animals had moral worth, and not just your 2 favourite cute ones, of course you'd be worried about what people are eating! If you mates went round shooting the dogs at dog's trust, you'd care about what they do in their spare time.

How can you be vegan and say 'I don't care what people eat'

Small rant"
vegan,Chomp Chocolate- all the “milk” chocolate goodness you want. It’s the real deal!,"I’m not a spokesperson or affiliated in any way. Just a huge fan. I bought their variety pack and “kookie” bars- so freakin good. Some of it’s gluten free too, so my husband with celiac can partake. 

It tastes like how you want sweet milk chocolate to taste! I also found a discount code of “MOOLESS” on their website and it worked :)

This really seems like an ad but I have been trying different chocolate out and it just doesn’t satisfy that tastebud. Just wanted to share! And if you’re worried about shipping and melty chocolate, they send it in a package with a biodegradable frozen pack. I know some people buy it on Amazon, but I’d recommend skipping Bezos and going straight to their website.

Anyone else have it? What are your other fave vegan sweets?"

vegan,How can a poor student dress vegan?,"So, before I went vegan I thought eating plant-based only is expensive, but I was wrong. Matter of fact it can be cheaper. But when it comes to clothes, I can't help but see how much more expensive the vegan alternatives are. In my case, wouldn't it be reasonable to buy second hand and only necessary things, and as my budget increases to start buying vegan clothes?"
vegan,"I buy the most expensive vegan food, and it’s cheaper than eating meat","We often hear the cliché that veganism is an elite diet for rich people. I was a poor student before I became vegan. Now I buy the most expensive olive oil, vegetables at the fancy vegetable store (which looks more like a museum to vegetables than a supermarket), fancy sherry vinegar, six kinds of Mexican chilli, a balcony full of Italian herbs…. And I spend less on food than when I used to buy cheep burgers as a student. Let everyone know: luxury veganism is cheaper than basic meat eating."
vegan,"Traveling for Work: Toledo, Who Knew?","So I'm in Toledo for the weekend for work and I was really really surprised at the vegan options here. There's even an all vegan Mexican place.

vegan,What would a high end expensive vegetarian or vegan restaurant look like?,"I see lots of expensive restaurants serving meat like $100 steaks that are used to wine and dine clients for business meetings and special events. What type of vegetarian food could a restaurant serve in the same role as the expensive meat dishes? I (physician) was recently invited by pharmaceutical salesperson to a meeting at a steakhouse but I didn't attend because I wouldn't be able to eat anything substantial. If I were a salesperson trying to sell to vegetarian clients, what kind of vegetarian food at a restaurant would have the message that this is high class stuff that they wouldn't otherwise have so they would attend my presentations. What's the equivalent of Kobe beef steak for vegans?"
vegan,New Vegan Question About Canned Beans,"I made pasta salad today with chickpea and lentil pasta and veggies. I added a serving of canned, rinsed chickpeas. I could barely eat them.

I want an easy method of adding protein to my meals and snacks."
vegan,What to use to coat food with bread crumbs,"Hi folks, I want to make a vegan Schnitzel and normally wou would coat the piece with flour, then coat it with an egg and water mix, then press it in breadcrumbs and fry the thing to completion. Since I want to make this vegan I need to know what I could use instead of the egg. I tried oil and margarine on 'fried green tomatoes' and the crumbs did stick but I did not like the taste. Any thoughts?"
vegan,Fishing nets.,"To start, I live on a lake. We have a restaurant around here that specializes in ""locally sourced fish!"". Last night I was outside late and I saw a slow moving boat pulling a fishing net under the cover of darkness. It was almost 1 in the morning. They know if they did it in the daytime people would see how messed up it is that they're mass-catching fish with their gigantic boat net just for a 5 star review from someone who'll forget about the meal within 30 minutes. I'm just so sad. They're taking the beautiful and diverse fish out of our lakes to be put on a plate for NO reason. I don't understand how this is legal or allowed. We even have preservation guidelines in place, how is it not listed anywhere that ""mass fishing for personal gain"" isn't allowed??? I'm so sad."
vegan,I'm writing a five minute speech on veganism which will be performed next week. Please could you take a look at it and give me some feedback/ fact check. Thanks. p.s It's not finished (I especially don't like the environmental paragraph) and so it appear jagged in some places.,"  

The world currently grows enough crops to feed 1.5x the world’s population, and yet almost a billion people still go hungry. Take Brazil, one of the biggest producers of the soybean- a good source of protein, carbs, fat, iron, calcium etcetera. But instead of feeding those soybeans to starving children in the favellas, the beans are sold to China and Western countries where we feed them to livestock. Everyone knows immense suffering and pain the animal agriculture industry causes to animals, but not a lot of people realise the widespread and universal pain it causes to everyone, that this industry is one of both animal and human exploitation, and for what?

From a young age we are brainwashed into believing that we need animal’s flesh and their secretions to be healthy, that we need cow’s lactations for calcium, and that we need fish oil for omegas. But we don’t, the same companies that say we need these things financially benefit from our purchases of those products. Therefore, there is an incentive from them to want us to buy those products. If you actually look into the science and statistics, you’d find that on average vegans live 15 years longer, vegans have a lower risk of pretty much every non communicable disease and vegans can easily get protein, calcium, omegas and B vitamins. I won’t bore you with the details but be assured that if you do your research, you will be a lot healthier with a vegan diet. 

So we don’t have to eat animal products, in fact quite the opposite, so how can we justify putting pigs into gas chambers? Dragging mother cow’s calves away from them merely hours after birth to maximise the amount of milk we steal? Raising chickens at such a quick rate, to such a heavy weight, that they can’t stand up? When will we realise that our tastebuds, the sensory pleasure we get from consuming animals is not worth more than their entire existence? When will we realise that animals have a right to a lift of peace and tranquillity just like us? When will we realise that future generations will look at our treatment of animals in the same way that we look at slavery? 

That is if there are any future generations, animal agriculture is one of the leading causes of climate change. Plastic straws make up less than 1% of plastic in the ocean, whereas fishing nets make up about 20% of plastic in the ocean, so why is it that we go so far to say that fishing is good for the ocean, but view plastic straws as the epitome of evil. It’s simple, people like fish and so aren’t willing to give it up, therefore they willingly become complacent, they willingly become ignorant. Whereas it’s easy for us to be against plastic straws, sure paper straws get a little mushy, but we can live with it. As well as this animal farming uses: 70% of agricultural land; is a leading cause of deforestation; the loss of biodiversity and water pollution.

So surely, at some point, we have to open our eyes, we have to stop letting the screams of dying animals fall on deaf ears simply because it makes us feel uncomfortable. Afterall, society will only progress if we are willing to challenge the dominant paradigms of our time. We clearly care for animals or believe we do, animals like dogs and cats are arbitrarily chosen to live in our homes, be treated like members of the family and have laws that protect them. So why is it that other animals (who are identical in every single way that matters) are viewed as nothing more than objects, denied of their own autonomy’s and left to die in a pool of their own blood on the floor of a slaughter house. Let’s stop this hypocrisy, lets stop this bloodshed, let’s look after our incredibly complex and precious planet… Let’s go vegan."
vegan,GTFO It’s Vegan sells nonvegan items.,"What an annoying and disappointing discovery. Just received some screenshots from a vegan acquaintance about some [cheeses](https://gtfoitsvegan.com/product/olives-chili-white-cheese-by-kourellas/) being sold by GTFO It’s Vegan. ([Here](https://ibb.co/RNSJYbj) is a screenshot in case they try to edit the pics. [Here](https://ibb.co/HnwNWKt) is a pic shared to another vegan group I’m in, showing what this person received in their order.)

It sure would be nice to have one “vegan” shop where we don’t have to worry about inspecting labels. The fact that this isn’t vegan is quite obvious if you even glance at the front of the package, but I’m sure a lot of people buy stuff here without even looking. You know, because of the site name."
vegan,The double standard,"So there was a post on here yesterday that mentioned someone was mad because they felt that their friends were obligated to accommodate them for vegan options and they did not. 

In my eyes, to anyone who feels the same, if they are obligated to accommodate you, then the same is true for the other way around. 

So are they really obligated? Are you going to cook meat for them when they come over to your house or party?

Or is this a double standard that no one wants to admit to?"
vegan,cruelty free milk?,"Okay I know this is the vegan subreddit and I'm asking about normal cow milk but I didn't know where else to post this. 

So I'm vegan and my bf is not. Which is fine, he cooks vegan food for us and doesn't mind and I am okay that he isn't vegan. But this man LOVES milk. He drinks like multiple cartons a week. So I was wondering if there were any known brands out there that actually treat the cows well and that sort of thing so I can have more peace of mind."
vegan,"How do you really, truly know when you are doing all that you can?","I’m really struggling with this. Every few weeks I start realizing that there’s more I could be doing, so I end up cutting out more and more and more, and I don’t know when I’ll actually feel that I’m doing all that I can.

I’ve been vegan for a few years but I just didn’t think it was enough. I cut out “fake meat” and “fake milk” pretty shortly after going vegan too. Then I began cutting out anything that reminded me of animal products in any way: any red or pink foods, anything that is dried, etc. and then I realized my diet of plants was stealing the foods animals need, so I cut out greens and any wild grown plants because animals need those to eat instead of me. I also cut myself off from all “horror” content because I could not support fictional depictions of violence or ”monster” creatures while being against animal abuse in real life. I had 2 accounts banned for my activism. Hell, I’ve even stopped using words that insult animals, like “cowlick” in reference to hair. 

I’m on a super strict diet now of basically only root vegetables, water, and coconut water because they are the foods animals eat the least, and they resemble animal products the least. However, recently I learned that pulling root vegetables out of the ground is harmful to the ecosystems and encourages violent behavior because it is an outlet for aggression, and there are cultures that do not eat roots for this reason, and I now feel like I have no safe foods. 

I constantly worry about the C02 I emit in my breath harming animals. I worry about the amount of water I drink not leaving enough for animals. I don’t use a car, but me using public transit hurts animals. At some point during my day I must speak to or pay someone who hurts animals and that is on me. I just feel like am not doing enough and every time I cut something out, I remember 25 more things I’m doing that hurt animals.

When do you truly feel like you’re doing all you can? My brain always says “the only way you can truly do all you can is to no longer exist” and I do... kinda.. agree with that. But is there a way to do “all you possibly can” while still being alive?"
vegan,"Are gunting and fishing video games considered carnist, speciesist and/or vegan ?","I ask this cause a friend of mine invited me over to him so we can play some hunting games. When i heard this, i felt like it's a dilemma. 

They are video-games and shouldn't be taken seriously. For example, just cause i play GTA V or i HOI4, it doesn't mean i am gonna start a military or criminal career, just like if playing Wild Hunt with him won't make me a hunter.

Ofc, we usually overlook the potential influence video-games can have on us. If we are not careful, it could drive us to believe things that aren't true, like our potential to do some stuff, false morality, etc.

Should i accept his offer after all, cause i wouldn't do this irl, and maybe also talk to him about real-life concequences of hunting, or reject his offer ?"

vegan,Islamic co worker said she they have to eat meat as a part of their religion. Is it true?,"I have a coworker who is Muslim and from Pakistan, I am from India and vegan for a year and vegetarian since birth.

We were just talking about some restaurants and she tells me how she can’t have non halal meat so it’s so difficult for her to find a restaurant to go out, so I mentioned that she can try vegan or even vegetarian dishes, there is no tension about finding halal meat and she can enjoy different cuisines, and we are in California where literally every restaurant has vegan vegetarian options ! 

And she gets very passive aggressive and tells me her religion requires her to have meat.

Another incident, I am suffering from PCOS and enlarged liver, and she kept on mentioning that’s because I don’t eat meat.

She’s a good coworker and everyone loves her but I can’t shake of the feeling that she’s passive aggressive and literally thinks she’s better than other people cause she eats HALAL meat!"
vegan,Macros,"I find attempting to go even plant based 5 days out of the week is hard with numbers. Meeting macros in itself is already difficult not to mention adding the vegan/plant based option. 

There’s a edemame spaghetti that’s 68g of protein for the whole box but I’m not trying to eat that every single day. Not to mention eating too many carbs.

I don’t mind carbs. But if I’m told I should be eating around 180-200 carbs a day eating way more than that seems excessive. I find vegan food or natural food has a lot of carbs and not so much protein. I caneat seitan, tempeh, but that’s too processed to be eating everyday. 

Does anyone know any natural foods that are decent in protein or in carbs?? I could do edemame everyday 2 cups but that’s only around 25grams. 

If anyone knows or is willing to help:

2200-2500 calories per day

Around (per day)
185-200g carbs
160-180g in protein 
100-115 in fat

Depending on light - moderate activity.

I don’t feel like having protein shakes. So for the most part I want mostly natural food. Adding nutritional yeast as well.

Help please :)"
vegan,Filling meal ideas to keep in my purse for an event?,"I'm going to an all-day event where only non-vegan food will be provided, I won't have access to a microwave and I can't sneak away to my car. I've been vegan for about a year, but have been working from home where I had easy access to my fridge 24/7 so constant access to snacks has spoiled me and I haven't run in to the problem of needing a super filling packable vegan meal until now.

Any ideas for something that doesn't need to me refrigerated that I can stick in my bag and munch on throughout the day? It's a networking event so there will be light drinking and I'm worried about drinking on nothing but carrot sticks and getting sloppy.  All the ultra filling vegan foods I can think of like avocado or lentils need to be refrigerated or aren't very portable.

Hard mode: I can't have nuts, otherwise something like peanut butter would be perfect for this."

I have a quick advice request. I’ve been having breathing issues (not related to veganism as it was there before) but I’m slightly hesitant to visit a doctor about it.

vegan,A lot of fooled people,"Since for the last ten minutes I read a lot of bullshit in here, let me get clear:

If you decide going vegan you can't be vegan today, vegetarian/meateater tomorrow, then again vegan after a few days. Of course there is a period when you need to stop eating meat, but asking ""is it ok to switch on and off""... No, it's not ok! Vegans do not consume any milk, eggs, gelatin or whatever coming from animals. They do not pay for fur, leather and tested on animals cosmetics and medicine if that's not life saving. 

Is it vegan to eat non vegan if it's gonna be wasted... Is it a murder to kill someone who wants to die? Quit playing stupid please, you know the answer of those questions. You are acting like it's such a great sacrifice. First, your health will only going to improve. Yes, you may get sick, but it won't be not because of being vegan. There are vegan athletes, vegan scientists, vegan actors... Einstein himself was a vegan.  
Second thing is you are helping environment and animals. 80% of lands cut and burned are to make more farms to raise more animals to have more meat and dairy. Don't you think that's insane? 

Btw I would love to see more facts on this page, not just memes. Do you know 90% of ocean fish is going for sushi?"
vegan,any advice on how to have few slip-ups as a new vegan + as a college student?,"i’m starting tomorrow, cold turkey. i’m not worried about cravings influencing me, i never liked meat or eggs much and i’m lactose intolerant. but i still ate foods that contained those products as ingredients sometimes (croquetas, baked goods, etc)

i’m just worried that my absentmindedness will cause me to mess up more than i realize. i usually don’t like reading nutrition labels, since i’m recovering from an eating disorder and it’s a bit triggering right now. i know some packages have the vegan label on them so i will refer to that. 

apart from that, do you guys have advice? i’ll be living on a college dorm starting next month so im also interested in any advice for being vegan in college."
vegan,Activism works.,"I know being the “annoying vegan” can get tiring, but here’s a little reminder that your activism, big or small, has an impact. I frequently repost videos and infographics from animal rights accounts on my public Instagram story and talk about animal rights a lot on my private story. I’ve influenced 2 people to go vegan - 2 straight cis men, which is in my opinion the hardest demographic to get thru to. I know sometimes it feels like talking to a brick wall, but this is a reminder that as exhausting as it can be to advocate for animals when it feels like people aren’t listening, it is ultimately worth it. You can’t get the world to go vegan, but small-scale outreach is really important."

vegan,Is it ok to buy from fast food places as a vegan?,"Until recent history I'd avoid doing it unless I was dragged into one by friends and family while on the road or something, but recently I've been ordering vegan stuff from Domino's and man it's soooo good. I told myself I'd only do it occasionally, but I've been doing it more often recently. I'm wondering though, what do you guys think? Do you buy from these places? Should I stop doing it? I feel like there's not a huge difference between it and buying from any other company or restaurant, which also sells non-vegan stuff. But maybe that's just an excuse, I know these companies are some of the worst when it comes to animal rights, and it's that which is why up until now I felt I had to avoid them."
vegan,I need some encouragement,"So I go vegan on and off (or maybe I should say plant based because a vegan wouldn't do it on and off). I really do feel awful about exploiting animals but I fall back into eating small amounts of animal products mainly because it's more convenient and also partially because I like the way they taste. And they are SUCH shitty reasons to partake in something so cruel. I don't go out of my way to buy animal products but my partner isn't interested AT ALL in becoming vegan and he doesn't want our kids to be (I'm very open with them about what they are eating and the practices that are involved in that but they are young and I don't think they really understand. I also believe it should be their decision. I provide them with plant foods which tbh they barely eat any veg, it's awful) my partner also hates it when I'm vegan because he sees it as an inconvenience. So in order to keep peace I make plant foods (this is like 90% of meals) but when he decides to cook something with animal products I just eat it. And I feel awful about it. But my family is the most important thing in the world to me. To be clear he's not a prick and he's not like telling me I can't or anything lol. He just complains that there's no point in cooking if I won't eat it and that the stuff I cook is rubbish and too expensive (we are on a budget). I just hate that negativity all the time in our house, it really brings me down. I just wondered if any of you have been in a situation like this before and if you have any advice? Thanks."

vegan,I'm helping my friend try a plant-based diet for 30 days! One problem...,"My best friend has been wanting to go plant based for some time now, as their mother and sister have been vegetarian for awhile. I'm vegan and we spend so much time together, so I'm often telling them about my ethical view on things, the benefits to the human body, the benefits for the collective, etc. We often cook plant based meals together, and they've done a decent job of reducing their intake on their own.. I'm proud of them for that! They came to me yesterday to ask for my help in sticking to plant based for the whole month, so I agreed. I have one issue, I asked them why they want to switch and they said they are doing this for their health and to lose weight. Honestly I'm a bit heartbroken that they didn't list the ethics as a reason... they agreed to watch dominion with me, and I'm feeling an urge to continue to push the ethics side. What would you do? What do you think is the most effective strategy here in helping them see that veganism is a great choice for a lifelong lifestyle from a holistic perspective?"
vegan,"""But what if you were on an island with a cow?""","Ah yeah, you got me! Because we're all in this situation at least once a day right? And supermarkets don't exist where you can buy other foods.

And this is partly thanks to Earthling Ed but also a lot of other people.

But holy shit, I didn't expect to get the same dumb questions that many times.

**Yes, I am totally protein deficient, because cows are the only thing that contain protein in the entire world. Nuts and beans don't exist. And I am on an island everyday.**

**Also, we should base our morallity on what lions do. And plants have feelings.**

Bonus points of its budget friendly 😭 Currently trying to get groceries after months of eating out every day and I’m out of ideas. I’m trying to think of meals to make but a lot of them aren’t really ADHD friendly, especially for those times when I can’t really do anything 🥲🙃"
vegan,Vegetarian moment,"I know this vegetarian lady, or so she says she's a vegetarian at least. Today she took off her watch and it had the words ""genuine leather"" engraved on the inside of the wristband. 

She has animal-obsessed son. This kid is 11 and knows about so many species of animal, ones your typical kid or even adult has no idea about, and he is absolutely in love with anything that walks, crawls, slithers, swims, dives, flies, glides, runs, hops, you name it. He loves just about every single creature you can think of. Adores them to the max. 

He was never told what meat was and never questioned it, until one day he cried to his mum asking if chicken the food and chicken the animal were the same thing. Only this one caught him out because of the name. His vegetarian mum, who is vegetarian because she ""loves animals"" then lied to him and told him that chicken the food and chicken the animal are not the same thing at all and that nobody eats animals, so that her son would continue eating meat. 

He's 11. He adores animals and is forced to eat them by being lied to and told that what he's eating isn't made from animals at all."
vegan,I hate how much being vegan has destroyed my view of humanity as a whole,"I've only been vegan for a little over a year, but the sheer amount of times I've seen otherwise kind and intelligent people rush to use the most inconsistent and ridiculous justifications to continue supporting unnecessary animal abuse is breaking me (its traditional so its ok, its natural so its ok, we're able to do it so it's ok, we can't cause zero harm so it's ok, we decided to harm them ahead of time so it's ok, we get pleasure out of it so it's ok, people who aren't us need to do so to survive so it's ok, i read a headline that plants feel pain so it's ok, a supplement is too big of an inconvenience so its ok, etc)

People who will be outspoken critics of other forms of injustice will go out of their to shame and deride anyone who dares speak out against this one, blaming those activists and not themselves for their own choice to continue hurting animals

I sincerely wish that it was just a matter of education that would get people on the right side of things. Dominion changed me overnight. I wouldn't even mind if someone needed time to change but at least recognized the injustice taking place and the need to address it.

But so many people just don't. There's nothing stopping them and they get pleasure out of it, so that's where it ends for them. I used to think humanity was special, but it feels like everytime I see someone be confronted by veganism, it highlights how simple we still are"
vegan,Does beyond beef have a plastic taste to anyone else and find the texture too realistic or could I be too sensitive,"Even when I seasoned and smothered it in sauce I could still taste a strange lingering plastic flavor.  
And I almost gagged eating it due to texture and the way it looked when cooking, I had to keep reminding myself it wasn’t *actually* ground beef lol.  
  
I just don’t think that imitation meat is for me at this point but maybe I got a weird package?  
Or maybe I’m just too sensitive to this sort of thing and should just stick to non imitation meat, which is fine with me :)"
vegan,Most carnists don’t give a shit about their pets.,"“Why love one, but not the other” isn’t really a convincing argument for veganism when most people’s entire view of animals INCLUDING cats and dogs is fucked up. 
When I say they don’t give a shit about them, what I mean is they don’t give a shit about them any more than they give a shit about their phone or any of their other material items. They put their dogs in kennels all day while they’re at work instead of properly training them. They break their horses back riding them. They dump animals at the shelter to be murdered whenever they’re no longer convenient to care for. They only take interest in these animals when they are babies, then toss them aside or begin to neglect them when they grow older. They view them as their property. They dress them up in little outfits, even when they don’t like it, force them to compete in shows, yell at them, scream at them, beat them. When they think the vet bill isn’t worth paying, they murder their animals and then call it compassionate. They think ALL animals are for their use."
vegan,Is Jon Venus the worst former Vegan youtuber of all time?,"So I started following him about 5 or 6 years ago, I was impressed with all his vegan gains and general outlook on things. Then he feared for his kids health (valid), but didn't even say why, and then said it required his whole family to eat meat again. 

Then he had the nerve to say that he doesn't owe anyone any explanations, which makes no sense, obviously you are public figure that based his whole career on veganism, so of course you are going to need to have an explanation. 

Then he admits his entire income was destroyed because Vegans jumped ship on him (duhh). And he said he realizes he was wrong and he was going back to veganism. Okay great, there is a lot of disinformation out there, maybe he got confused and decided to come back. 

Welp, he saw that he basically burned all his prior bridges, lost endorsements and basically vegan followers were not coming back. So, now he's back again to eating meat, now he eats it every day he says. 

He may be the most confusing person I've seen online. He's all over the place in terms of his beliefs, he recently said he broke his leg and then basically let it heal on his own after the doctors said it needed a cast and now complains he's completely fine.

I'm just flabbergasted at how idiots are basically influencers. I could at least give him a smidgeon of respect if he explained what he was specifically worried about with a vegan diet for him or his kid. What are you missing? He's made hundreds of videos talking about the benefits he saw from going vegan.

Now he's against it and throwing it in people's faces. Honestly even if I ate meat I don't think I could stand this guy, he's my vote for the worst."
vegan,Main meal for school project,"The kid is designing a 3 course meal over half term for a school assignment and we're stuck for ideas for the main. She decided she wanted the menu to be vegan. Looking for some inspiration please 😊

Starter we're doing pea puree with ""scallops"" (oyster mushrooms)

Dessert a vegan Bakewell tart with dairy free custard.

We're only using the stalks of the oyster mushroom so if the main used the tops of the mushroom so it didn't go unused that would be ideal

TIA 😊"
vegan,I really love Earthling Ed's videos,"Earthling Ed's videos were one of the reasons why I became a vegan. There are some other people too, but the way he can explain things really gives you no other option than to become a vegan.

His videos have also helped me when I explain things to others, because most people say the same things, like: ""But where do you get your protein?"", ""But lions eat meat"" and ""But I like the taste"".

I haven't gotten in many arguments or debates, but it really helps me to learn more and to explain things to other people.

Really like binge-watching his videos lol"
vegan,Violence and normopathy,"Let's say one of the ""owners"" of the big chains like Mc'd, KFC, Subway etc. wanted to switch all their animal based products with plantbased, and they made a statement saying they tested it and you won't even know unless you're told so. 

There would be outcry, people would rage online and to a certain extend they would lose some business at least in the beginning until the dimwitts cooled down enough for a sensible debate and wider tasting and reviews could even make it into the debate without being shunned at first glance.  

The only issue here is the institutionalized gambling called stocks which in this and many other cases means that the fear of the lowest denominator of intelligence will spark a sell-of making it into an avalance. And this stiffles innovation, change, environmentalism and actual goodwill like nothing we've seen before. Fear of the ignorant masses has ended up breeding and ignorant mutant masses incapable of logic and reason in a matter of a few generations. All because finances has become just as predatory as the meat industry itself feeding of off suffering, human decay and amoralism. 

People are so afraid of going against the systemic and normalized psychopathic tendencies in our society that they themselves often aquire Stockholm syndrome and defend it, because: ""tHaT's tHe WaY iT hAs bEeN fOrEvEr"" but I beg to differ. Human civilization has not always been this corrupted and ignorant, but we've let our guard down on capitalism and we took the bribe of cheap crap sent right to our door made by small eastern childwork with funds and materials stolen from Africa, but you know who really cares. Diets of mainly sugars, caffeine and alcohol has yielded perhaps the most impulsive, thoughtless and aggressive generation we've ever seen and the people who sold us this lifestyle uses this behavior to argue against reasoning with the demands of the masses while they just shove useless items down our consumerist throats. 

Veganism is about setting your own instant grattification aside for our extended family, the environment and to dare going against this systemic psychopathy that has seeped into most cultures around the world by now. Gambling with your money as a stockholder is in no way vegan this is feeding the beast, bitcoin is surely one of the most disruptive and productive things that have happened in a long time in finances as it offers an alternative to this rigged shitshow we call the economy. 

I'm tired of the glorifying of capitalist values in a passive aggressive prestige-economy, even in my highly developed culture they're rife with this nonsense. I'm tired of how we're nudged into arguing amongst ourselves with clever divisive tactics, instead of focusing on the real issues, how billionaries in the media is only puppets of the real mafiafamilies running this earth into the ground, while profiting on every single step of the way down. 

Sorry about the rant but I've began to fight every inch of me participating in this crazyshow of normopathic behavior and I feel like we're being dumbed down increasingly in these times as to not be able to resists or question the status quo, enabling selfcensoring of the masses by ridicule and soon direct online and economic censorship if we're following the current trend. 

Edit: Ok so already they began to censor directly online, freeze people's assets in Canada and many eastern nations. Yeah thing's aren't looking dandy no.."
vegan,You know when someone says they're vegan when they're really just health conscious?,"They rely on people not knowing what vegan means to pick and choose what they eat at social events. 

That happened to me with a coworker. She said she was vegan when she was eating a ""vegan pizza"" without cheese but with vegetables clearly cooked in butter. 

I pretended to get excited and said ""No way, me too!""

The look of shock on her face was priceless. I don't think she's met a real vegan before. 

Since then I make sure to give her a ~friendly~ reminder at every business social event what is and isn't vegan 

Usually nothing at these events are vegan except raw fruits and veggies. Now she's forced to eat the scraps like I do, or be forced to come clean about not being vegan. 

Maybe I'm evil but at least I'm reducing animal abuse and fighting vegan imposters 😈"
vegan,What conspiracies have you heard around veganism?,"My family are unfortunately deep into the conspiracy realm and I know they have thoughts about veganism but don’t mention it to me because I’m very passionate for the cause. I’ve heard mum say not to eat “fake” meat, especially beyond burgers because… bill gates endorses them?? Then proceeds to talk about ‘the global agenda’. I’ve tried looking on the internet on what she meant by that but can’t find much and frankly I’m too scared to ask her haha

Anyone know a conspiracy around bill gates and plant based meat? 

Any others??"
vegan,Craving meat,"I’ve been vegan for about 5 years now and one craving never went away and I think it never will: medium rare steak. Like seriously, I don’t crave chicken nuggets, tenders, burgers, fish, pate, hotdogs, salami… whatever the fuck. All of those have amazing substitutes, very life like and even more delicious. Of course I’ll just deal with the craving and will never go back and would never actually give into it (id rather throw myself under a train then eat a carcass ever again), but it’s just interesting to me how I still crave the flavor of a bloody steak."
vegan,Family gatherings,"I don’t really like attending family gatherings with this side of the family. My dad’s side is very educated and my mom’s isn’t and you can tell. As a vegan and a girl I have trouble standing these people. Ever since I started puberty they had remarks about my body, particularly breasts. That was accompanied by inappropriate touching. And I made clear that I didn’t like it, to a nonexistent change. And now it has gotten worse with some people telling me that animal products contribute to “good womanly qualities” with gestures towards my breasts. And comments like: “You will need that to get married” and so on. Keep in mind that most of them are overweight or obese. And honestly I have issues with my body and being with them has me spiralling. It makes me feel so small and voiceless, the other side of the family is empathetic at least but here it feels cruel."
vegan,What do you guys think to freegan? (If it’s vegan it’s free),"I saw a TikTok and it just seems weird to me. People were using the justifications of “it’s more vegan ethically to eat it than waste food”. Which doesn’t make sense to me because it’s from the approach of environmentalism and that’s not really vegaism? Sure it’s a part, but veganism is mainly about the animals so personally I couldn’t bare to eat anything with animal products in it. I don’t understand why they just wouldn’t give it away to someone else? 

Someone else used the justification that “the animal died for nothing”, which is just an argument used by meat eaters?"
vegan,Is being a vegan safe if I have heart problems?,"Hi everyone! I’m trying to change my diet to a fully plant based one but there are a few things that I am concerned about. Firstly like the title says I have heart issues, more specifically Mitral valve prolapse (leaking valve) and irregular heartbeat. I’m worried about how a vegan diet could effect my heart and overall health. Also I am prone to anaemia. If anyone here has similar issues I would love to hear your stories and any tips and advice. 
Thank you in advance!"
vegan,Unpopular Opinion: Eating meat and dairy is like performing incest and murder for sustainance,"I'm sure some people at some point in time in the middle of a desert needed to rely on the milk and meat of cattle to sustain themselves, maybe even performed incest to grow their small limited population. But these problems don't exist today, or at least they shouldn't with current advancements we have as humans.

So please stop murdering animals to eat their meat, and inseminating them to drink their milk. Unless you're a biblical character that regularly performs incest, or so overburdened by hunger that he thinks his son is a lamb ready for slaughter, or casually organize meet ups to circumcize each other with an axe, you don't need to murder or abuse animals to have your dinner. 

You don't need to eat animals to sustain yourself in 2022."
vegan,How effective really is street activism?,"I'm looking to become more active with my veganism, and one method I see around a fair bit is street activism. Mostly I see people holding up pictures of abused animals and speaking to those interested. My question is how effective really is this? Most people walk right by, and I feel there's a chance it could evoke more of a ""militant vegan"" vibe. What are your thoughts? And side question, what are your preferred methods of activism?"

vegan,Why do vegans promote veganism from an empathy/emotional perspective and not a health benefit one?,"For years I was put off looking into the practice as it was marketed to me as something you ""only do if you really like animals"".
As someone who actually dislikes animals for the most part (not in the sense that I'd promote cruelty but I'd never want to be around them) I had no interest in looking into it further.
It was only recently when someone mentioned certain personal health benefits that I actually became interested in vegan dietary practices.

How did you become interested in the practice and how do you promote it to other people? Are you/they all animal lovers?"
vegan,So yesterday I read about how Venus (of the williams sisters') is Chegan - vegan with cheat days.,"Several of my friends turned vegetarian / vegan over the years, and I've always seen one esp. eat chicken or fish when high. How do you folks reconcile with situations like these?

Without being militant about it - cause I typically don't like open, loud confrontations and anyone drunk can be loud. But I feel uncomfortable about .. esp. when we are not high and they preach others."
vegan,I struggle to get over people eating animal products/talking about animal products,"I guess I suffer with vystopia. It's only worsened by my autism, I get pretty strong fixations that can kill my positive mood and trigger depression. 

I used to be able to handle things a year or two ago. I was confident, I could watch people eat animal products (As an ethical vegan) and not have a care in the world because I'm the one in the right here by choosing not to be cruel to animals. But as I grew up, now 25 years old, I realize it's really hard to cope. My sensory issues play a role into that, and somehow have worsened over time. I've developed a normalization of seeing that it's not normal to consume animal products. It's becoming unbearable because I'm aware that it's common, and now whenever people eat/talk about them, anywhere I can observe it, I can't help but attach that there was sentient life there once, and that the animal was exploited and treated cruelly.

It's worse when some of the nicest people in the world, I made a video on some of them [here](https://youtu.be/3UIxvpb7qf8), are still contributing to these things. I'm left with nowhere to turn to. Even in some of the online games I play, people are constantly talking about how they're about to eat breakfast with bacon and egg or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

What am I missing? Are animals actually not sentient or something? What do non-vegans see in animals that I do not? Help please"
vegan,"""You're gonna have to eat bugs one day"" Bitch Please","About a week or two ago I was on the phone with my best friend, and somehow we got on the topic of the world switching to bug farming instead of animal farming. This is the second time we've talked about this, and last time I ended up sending him a study discussing the efficiency of bug farming vs plant farming. Which I'm positive he didn't bother reading bc he wouldn't have repeated the same BS to me in our recent conversation if he'd read what I sent him.

A while back he told me to stop sending him vegan activism stuff (like videos and studies about why you should go vegan) bc ""being pushy would only make him not want to go vegan even more"". But then he has the audacity to spout some nonsense like ""we're all gonna have to eat bugs in the future to sustain ourselves"" so this time I sent him Earthling Ed's video on the topic afterwards. 

He didn't acknowledge it of course, but if it crossed his mind that he asked me not to share stuff like that then he needs to keep his mouth shut, because he shouldn't expect me not to throw sources in his face after I call him on his BS. I'll throw every piece of research I can find at him, and it's not my fault if he refuses to have his opinions changed by evidence.

I try my best to base my opinions on science, I'm capable of acknowledging when I'm wrong and changing my views to keep growing as a person. I wouldn't have become vegan if I wasn't able to be critical of my own beliefs. It's incredibly frustrating when other people refuse to do the same."
vegan,best vegan protein sources? any creative recipes?,"my mom is recently vegetarian and aspiring vegan. she’s worried about having a balanced diet and not getting enough protein. her friend was telling her to just have some meat or fish but she doesn’t want to, and i don’t want her to think that’s the only way to get enough protein. she likes beans, nuts, and veggies which all have protein but i think it’s hard to incorporate them on the daily without getting repetitive."
vegan,we need to talk,"so you probably know about some very unfortunate recent events such as the school sho*ting in Texas, or the s_xual ab_use victim known as KallMeKris on TikTok. We need to get some of our members under control. Believe me I’m vegan myself, and being vegan is fine. But some people are treating said abuse like something that can just be brushed under the rug. We need to get our shit together and try and be more civilized with non-vegans. I know I may get a lot of hate for this (and I don’t give a single shit) but I hope some of you guys can understand the problems happening in the vegan society right now."
vegan,A scene in succession that made me think of you guys,"There is a scene in the first season where Tom takes the new guy Nick to a fancy restaurant and they do the whole ""tasting menu"". The finale of this is where they put a cover on their heads and they eat a deep fried ""song bird"" whole. Nick gags and can barely eat it but tom is in like ecstasy. Tom then tells him weird taste is brains and I started gagging and had to fast forward it. I don't know why but this scene lives in my head now and I think about it several times a day and gag. It's just so fucking disgusting lol. Wondering if anyone else has seen this part?"
vegan,i'm alone,"living ethically takes work, effort, and discipline.

I feel utterly alone in this. i came home to a huge tub of honey on the counter. it takes a single bee it's ENTIRE life to make just a teaspoon of that

my partner originally wanted to go vegan. now they've completely given up and it makes me suicidal, because I want to spend my life with him. he ate a whole fucking sausage right next to me and when i confronted him about it he completed that 'its so hard' but ITS WORSE FOR THAT DEAD PIG. no one cares. no one in my life gives a fuck and im alone. it only makes me feel MORE isolated and alone when someone only humors me, and now feeling like my life partner only humored me this whole time is making my heart hurt. no one cares and I feel like shit. no one cares and im alone"
vegan,Do you avoid refined sugar?,"The way it was explained to me is that most refined sugar has a complex pathway from refinery to distributor to whatever company that needs it. A pack of candy could be totally vegan sometimes and other times totally not.

My brother and I (we went vegan together and often live in the same place) determined it was not feasible living in the city and we wouldn't bother with checking for sugar the way we do with palm oil. 

How about you/what are your thoughts on this highly prevalent non-vegan ingredient?"
vegan,The Next Time Someone Tells You to Stop Comparing Animal Suffering to Slavery or the Holocaust...,"You aren't comparing atrocities. Atrocities are all bad and should not be compared. No atrocity should be minimized.

What you are comparing is the *normalization* of accepting an atrocity happening.

It is the arguments used by people who commit atrocities that match in logic to arguments used to justify animal brutality. It is the identical cognitive dissonances that are worth referencing.

You are not saying the animal atrocities today are as bad as other past or current atrocities. You are saying the arguments used today are as flawed as any argument used to justify any atrocity in history."

vegan,"To Follow Up on My ""Vegetables are Cheap"" Post... My $103.57 30-Day Shopping List Inclusive of Fruit and Vegetables","I submitted a post yesterday that got a ton of criticism. The major complaint was that fruits and vegetables aren't cheap and you can't eat them on a limited budget. I deleted it because my inbox was being spammed with the same three comments over and over and over again. 

* ""This food does not meat my caloric need in their entirety."" Well, obviously. It was a picture of $19 of vegetables. 

* ""Its impossible to be able to afford fruits and vegetables on a budget. Lettuce is $9 where I live! Rice and potatoes are rare and expensive!"" I don't find that to be the case at all. 

* ""You used plastic bags for your produce!"" That one was my bad. I didn't feel like putting my celery on the filthy conveyor belt. In future I will reduce my plastic bag usage.

This shopping list would easily feed two people with an additional $20-$30 for additional variety. It includes 10lbs of rice, 5lbs of dry beans, and 10lbs of potatoes. Another $25 would add more vegetables and fruit as well as a few more snacks. 

I live in Tempe, Arizona and shop at Fry's which is Kroger in other states. Arizona is ranked at like the 18th most expensive state at the moment but I live near ASU where everything is a little more expensive. 

I'm sure someone will complain that I eat and buy things like bread, pasta, and cereal because they ""aren't healthy."" I feel my diet is healthy overall and those are things that I like to eat. YMMV.

It seems like some form of anemia, as my symptoms are cold hands and feet, passing out, lethargy, and this has been very disruptive to my life. I am not in a place where other people can drive me around, and the fear/discomfort that comes with driving due to these health problems stresses me out to no end. I don't want to pass out while driving and die. I went to the doctors and got a blood test, and iron, b12, all of my levels are normal and I was not diagnosed with anemia. I was borderline low on vitamin D so I started to supplement for that too. While I have seen improvements I do not consistently feel normal and I feel like I have to constantly monitor everything I eat just to BORDER the normality I had before. Lifting weights seems to make my symptoms go away, Like during and after a lifting session I don't have cold hands/feet and I feel alert again. The doctors just told me to start eating meat again and were no help. I don't have the time/capacity/money to keep going through the awful medical system just to be told to eat meat. I am frustrated because my bloodwork says that I am healthy when I am literally dealing with these constant symptoms looming over my life. I just want to feel normal and not have to eat animals. If anyone could point me into the direction of what I could be dealing with I would be very grateful. I feel lost and it doesn't feel like anyone is willing to help me. Doctors and family members just tell me to eat animal products again."
vegan,Ethical Dillema Involving Bugs,"I have the following dillema. Is it unethical to drive a car given that driving a car regularly will inevitably result in the death of dozens, if not hundreds or thousands, of bugs? 

Premise 1: 'Bugs' (used loosely to refer to insects, arachnids, etc) are morally considerable beings like humans, mammals, birds, etc.

 Premise 2: Driving a car regularly results in various bug deaths, such as rolling them over, smashing into them while driving (for example when they hit the windshield), etc.

Premise 3: It is impossible to regularly drive a car and avoid bug deaths. If you drive a car consistently you will kill various bugs over time.

Premise 4: air is unethical to consistently engage in behavior that threatens the lives of morally considerable beings, luke bugs.

Conclusion: It is unethical to drive a car.

This argument seems to hold for cars even if they did not effect the environment, for forms of public transit that are just as likely to kill bugs (trains and buses), and maybe even the most eco friendly forms of transportation like bike riding (I certainly have had bugs hit my face while bike riding).

While this argument is sensible, I find myself not wanting to forgoe transportation methods that are necessary and enjoyable for my every day life. Is it non-vegan to drive?? Is it okay to engage in behaviors, like driving, that I know will kill other beings, even if I do not want those activities to kill such beings?"
vegan,will impossible beef ever be cheaper than slaughterhouse beef?,"Impossible meat in my local Walmart is pretty well the same price as premium beef on the same shelf and I'm led to believe it's going to get cheaper and match the price of lower quality beef as well, but my grandma buys beef right from the butcher. By cutting out the middle man, she can get a pound of fresh, high quality beef for like $2

Will impossible beef ever be *that* cheap or is it only meant to compete with store-bought beef?"
vegan,Why does Vegan Cheese need to be used up quickly?,"I've had quite a few vegan cheeses, and I've never had them really go off after the said time? I'm not sure what the label is for when they say ""Once opened, consume within 3 days."" currently I have this vegan Mexicana cheese which has been in my fridge, opened, for 4 days. But it tasted a tiny bit different today? I'm unsure what causes it. There's no signs of mould, no white or blue spots, though I don't know what type of mould it would produce. I only had one or two stomach aches today that lasted a few minutes. Any ideas what it could be? I'm always a little worried about this because, I really can't eat that within 3 days (Others say 5). That's 1/4 each day, which is quite a few calories. Given I'm the only one who eats it, it doesn't make sense. 

I'm confused but also worried. Should I be worried?"
vegan,i want ice cream:(,"I just got my wisdom teeth removed, 4 of them, 2 days ago. According to my doctor, today is the worst day, swelling and pain wise.

Im 19, the teeth were still in the bone and they were laid down it was amazing 🙄


Im from Guatemala. 2 years vegan. I want chocolate ice cream. My mom keeps saying that this is somth medical so I could just get some, wich I wont. So I dont want to complain to her about this anymore. But i want to complain so here I am.

Ps. I dont like bananas."
vegan,Need to confess.,"I’m 17F. I don’t even know if I can call myself vegan anymore. I’ve posted on here before about my family (actively try to stop me from plant-based eating and belittle me when I talk about animals). Long story short: they limit the amount of vegan food that they buy. They’ve sat me down and told me I can’t buy (6) bananas, (2) mangoes, and (3)peaches every week because it’s “unnecessary” and “extra”. I’ve gotten advice on here to buy my own food but every time I’ve told my parents I’m going to do that they tell me “stop acting like we can’t buy your food”. So I’m backed into a corner. I used to eat peanut butter as my main source of energy but my health has rapidly declined as a result. Also, I think it’s worth mentioning I ate half a small/personal watermelon as a part of a meal one time and my mother yelled at me and called my father for “eating to much fruit”. I simply don’t have a sustainable way to be vegan because they won’t buy more fruits and veg but won’t let me buy it myself. Thoughts? Guidance?"
vegan,Vegan food in Chicago?,"Hi everyone!

Love Chicago and I can't wait to visit next weekend. Wanted to see if any of you have any recommendations for where to eat in Chicago!

What are your favorite vegan-friendly restaurants? The people that I'll be with aren't vegan or vegetarian, so the recommendations don't have to be 100% vegan.

Also - any recs for cool bars in the area? I'll be near Soldier Field, but will be there all day and I don't mind having to walk or drive somewhere."
vegan,Heavy metal songs that are about being against cruelty to animals,"I can only name 2, i was wondering if anybody knew any more?

I know that Angela Goslow from Arch Enemy is a vegan, but cant name any songs by them that are particually about that."
vegan,If I say something racist or misogynistic or offensive,"People will cancel me but if they kill animals and eat them nothing happens. Im pretty sure killing animals is worse than any offensive word in existence. How is it fair that a vegan like me can be canceled by people who kill and eat animals? The hypocrisy makes no sense. Even if I kill one dog, i'll end up in jail while animal eaters can kill thousands of smarter pigs in their lifetime with no consequence. I dont get this timeline"
vegan,Had a question about animal cruelty in my english assessment,"For the last question on my english assessment, we had to write a two page article about the following statement:
‘Some people campaign for animal rights, yet are perfectly happy to eat meat, go to zoos and keep pets. All animals should be free.’

I was so happy to have this question since I had so much to write about, it was amazing!!"
vegan,"I saw a claim that vegans have higher T levels than carnists. Can someone that knows what they're talking about please ELI5 why, or point me to some sources?","The person that made the claim pointed me to a study stating such, but they intentionally cut off the second part of the sentence in the study talking about how the T-levels are offset due to other reasons.  It felt incredibly disingenuous, and when I asked what the second part of the sentence meant they got defensive and attacked something I said in a different comment chain

I'm honestly just curious.  I'd love to learn about another added benefit to being vegan. But I don't want to recite it to others unless it's actually true!"

vegan,When non-vegans say veganism is expensive yet the meal you make every day cost about 70p and your weekly grocery bill is about £15 🤔,"I've been vegan for nearly 5 1/2 years but my boyfriend has just recently turned vegan a few months ago. Which has now reminded me of all the stupid things people say to you when you turn vegan.

I can happily say I don't get *too* much shit in my everyday life about veganism. My dad is vegan, mum is vegetarian, brother wants to turn vegan, 2 best friends support it, and now my boyfriend is vegan. My extended family is also generally supportive and don't really talk about it much anyway.

So now that he has gone vegan, he's been getting comments from family and friends which I find so annoying obviously. One of the reoccurring comments is ""it's so expensive/isn't that expensive?"" Luckily my boyfriend defends it of course and says it's not, but it still bugs me so much that people are so ignorant. My boyfriend said to his friend that meat isn't good for you and he said ""but you need red meat, right?""

I don't know the cost of all my meals, but I just did the math for 1 of them, and it was only 70p ""on it's own"", £1 with nooch &amp; chia seeds added which I just add for extra vitamins/health. Also, my grocery bill every week ranges from like £14-18 depending on if I need to restock a bunch of things at once or buy household products or whatnot. 

And I'm gluten free, so it would be even cheaper if I wasn't as there's certain products that I buy due to them being gluten free where their non-gluten free alternative is cheaper (ex. a canned soup I buy is 95p but the non-gluten one is like 50p!)

I wish this whole stigma about veganism being expensive would just go away 😩"
vegan,Alternative names to Vegan Milk Products,"I am curious if anyone is getting confused if someone says Almond Milk. Some people think that it is basically cow's milk with almond flavour. Some others claim that ""Almonds don't lactate so why call it Milk"". Being misled about a product can have harmful effects. 

What are the alternative names to call such products?"
vegan,"Was it easy for you to stop eating meat or did you struggle and if so, how did you overcome the difficulties?","I stopped eating meat (except fish) at 13/14, at 18 I went vegan (now I'm 23). It was quite easy to stop eating meat although I liked the taste but I'm not sure why - I think I was and am very convinced that it's wrong and that settled it. However I recently talked to a friend who would like to be vegetarian or pescetarian and is making an effort to, but she finds it difficult when she's in a restaurant or with her family because she says she is completely convinced it is wrong to eat meat but it's hard not being able to eat meals anymore that she used to enjoy all her life, and it feels a bit pointless sometimes, like it's not changing anything in the grand scheme of things. Although she struggles with self-loathing when she relapses.

Since for me it was pretty easy to stop eating meat I cannot fully relate to her and I was wondering how other people have dealt with that!"
vegan,How do I help a SO who's trying to change?,"Hello all, this is my first post here and I was hoping you guys could help me out.

I've been vegan for over a decade. I started when I was young and there was no difficult transition or cravings. It was a very easy, fun, and in my opinion, obvious change for the better in my life. Since then I've mostly ate simple vegetable meals such as curries, stir fry, chili, stews, and roasted veggies. I'm not very familiar with the best animal product alternatives out there.

My SO has recently decided to become vegan. I think this is great and she's really sticking to it 100% but she's having trouble finding a nice culinary rhythm. She craves things like barria tacos, chicken biscuits, and most of all, cheese in almost every meal. We took a 10 hour road trip yesterday and she mostly ate nothing at all. She seems disastisfied with the prospect of vegetables being a main course, like they aren't fulfilling in some way.

She'll say things like ""when I grew up, vegetables were a side,"" or ""a vegetable sandwich doesn't sound good,"" to which I reply ""that's why you taste your food instead of trying to listen to it."" She's obviously disastisfied with what she believes her options to be. She thinks I'm a great cook but kinda balks at the idea of eating the same food as me as if it's not a real meal (I eat huge, warm, and filling meals that I cook for myself every day.)

I'm not familiar with the best vegan alternatives out there and want to turn her on to the fact she can get her soul food and cheese fix without resorting to the byproduct of rape, fear, and pain. She says ""I don't like tofu,"" (maybe had one bite over the two plus years we've been together) and believes vegan cheese doesn't melt (I don't keep any stocked to prove this is obviously wrong.) She got a black bean burger out with a friend tonight and seemed unhappy that it was ""just beans mushed together.""

What are some of the best products/  recipes for someone in a situation like this? She doesn't like to cook at all so I was hoping to buy some nice substitutes for home to cook her myself or find a nice local vegan joint to take her out to. We live in Nashville so there are plenty of options. Any good cheese recommendations? Chicken? How can I help her?

I just want her to be happy with the great decision she has made! Thanks for the help."
vegan,Doing activism by arguing with redditors,"I'm a bit confused at people arguing for veganism with people on other subreddits. Arguing in comment sections with people online does not seem like an effective strategy for activism. I feel like building some kind of basic rapport is important for any form of outreach and this is a lot harder to do in this environment. I feel it is also a lot harder to discuss these topics in comment form and easier for people to not engage honestly. Almost every screenshot I've seen of this style of activism seems to be pretty ineffective.

Am I missing something here? Has anyone found success in this kind of strategy? Is it done because people like arguing and not actually done in an attempt to convince others? I feel like I would get pretty frustrated trying this."
vegan,"Thanks a lot, Taco Bell!","I used the app to buy 2 black bean crunchwraps, so I can eat one on the way to work and one for dinner at work.  Opened one up and it was beef.  I was upset, but ate it because I didn't want to go to work on an empty stomach.  Plus, by the time I realized it, I was already almost to work and would have been late if I had gone back.  Opened up the second at my dinner break, and it was also beef.  Needless to say, I didn't eat anything for dinner.  And the food in the vending machine is all non-vegan and any convenience stores near me are all closed, so I can't buy something small.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the second time this happened.  The first time, I shrugged it off as maybe they just made it wrong, which I know happens.  But all 4 crunchwraps were made wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, they just lost my business."
vegan,How old were you when you went vegan?,"just curious

vegan,"Is anyone here interested being a founding member and voice in a group that will exist at the intersection of the web3, climate and vegan movements?","I don't think I need to explain the environmental, economic, health and ethical costs caused by animal agriculture. I think most of our experiences have been similar in our vegan journey. When our eyes were first opened there was a feeling of wanting to get friends, family and strangers to see what we saw, to feel what we felt. However, this was often met with indifference at best and contempt at its worst. Eventually eroding our enthusiasm and relegating that passion to the passenger seat. 

I for one, like all of you, do not wish to live in a society where the grotesque tragedies of our culture's appetite causes widespread suffering. And it is now abundantly clear that Earth as we know it cannot survive either. Animal agriculture is responsible for at least 50% of all emissions with some estimates as high as 87% and the widespread ecological destruction it instigates is decimating wildlife on a scale not seen since the last major extinction events. 

There's a new framework called DAOs, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, that are essentially meritocratic groups with a shared bank account where funds are distributed via proposal votes.  I believe this could be a highly effective vehicle to empower individuals in our local communities to advocate for the vegan cause by providing them with the tools, knowledge and resources necessary to lead and inspire others to make the change. This past year a DAO formed in under 2 weeks and raised $40 million to bid on a copy of the US Declaration of Independence! I believe if there is enough momentum that brands would be willing allocate resources and form strategic partnerships to help further the cause.  

If this idea interests you and you would like to get involved at the ground level drop a comment or send me a dm."

vegan,Stop praising PETA!,"PETA is bad and should not be praised. PETA says there is no excuse for animal abuse. Using their logic, being ""ethical and vegan"" is not an excuse for

\-pseudoscience-PETA claims dairy causes autism. This has been proven false.

\-ableism-PETA shames people with autism and tells them to stop drinking milk.

\-sexism-Putting naked pregnant women in cages, comparing women to cows and hens, using ""sexy women"" to advertise, PETA has a history of sexism

\-euthanizing perfectly healthy animals- Most animals in PETA animal shelters end up being killed instead of adopted. 

\-bodyshaming-PETA has made fun of fat people for a long time. They tell fat people to ""stop eating animal products&lt;"" when in reality, losing weight isn't easy

\-sexualization of children-PETA puts pictures of naked people in front of literal primary schools. It is disgusting.

\-selling human bodies-PETA was exposed selling human bodies

\-shaming dead people-PETA made a tweet shaming Steve Irwin on his birthday when Google decided to honor him.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, PETA is a bad organization. But to add, PETA also doesn't even help animals. They don't really care.  PETA once freed lobsters into freshwater even though lobsters live in saltwater. They died. Thanks PETA."
vegan,"Anyone else concerned about ""molecular identical"" products?","I have seen a fair amount about new animal-free products being developed to be molecularly identical to animal-based products. Two examples are the milk made by yeast and lab-grown meat. 

I think this stuff could help bring people around to cruelty-free eating. However, since animal products aren't particularly healthy to consume, is anyone else going to avoid these? I would think a product molecularly identical to cow's milk wouldn't be much better for you than cow's milk. Anyone seen anything going into the actual nutritional value, etc.?"
vegan,What is really the MOST IMPORTANT reason to go vegan? (Controversial opinion...I don't think it's animals...),"Hi, friends! It seems to me that for most vegans, the MOST important and URGENT reason to go vegan is animal wellbeing. I would argue that while animal wellbeing is obviously hugely important, it is not by any means the most important factor (stay tuned, I'll explain below), and leaning on that particular argument so disproportionately can even hurt the vegan cause in some ways, because it can take attention away from where, I believe, it belongs: on the other existentially critical factors that are in fact FAR more urgent and important.

Specifically, animal agriculture is arguably the largest contributor to ecological destruction and climate change, which are on pace to wipe away everything that makes Earth capable of sustaining life. Without the Earth, we die. All of us, humans and animals. Humans will be the last to go (because we're \~crafty\~ like that), but if Earth becomes an inhospitable space rock, we won't last very long either. This issue isn't just moral, it's existential. These environmental factors are an EXTINCTION-LEVEL THREAT to all life on Earth.

So why does it seem like 90% of the vegan arguments I hear are about animal cruelty?

All that said, here's my list, ranked, of what I believe are the most important reasons (listed as very broad categories) to go vegan:

1. Environment
2. Antibiotic resistance &amp; pandemics (e.g., [https://youtu.be/9T\_mEHOOPfk](https://youtu.be/9T_mEHOOPfk))
3. Animal cruelty
4. Waste in general (i.e., meat being a hideously inefficient way to get calories; this is actually the fact that made me go veggie many years ago, along with #1)
5. Human nutrition/health (i.e., vegan diet is healthier)

What's your list, in what order, and why? Looking forward to seeing what you think--thanks, folks! :)"

vegan,How do I tell someone I’m vegan?,"So, I’ve been vegan for almost 2 months and I’m still getting used to the social aspect of it. I’ve told my parents, and since I’m an independent adult, they thankfully respect my new lifestyle. My boyfriend is eating more plant based than ever in his life and at this rate, he’ll be full vegan soon with me. Basically, I’ve never had to tell someone I’m not close to that I’m vegan.

I just started a new job in a kitchen at a nursing home last week, and I’ve made friends with a fellow dietary aide and the cook. The cook is an old man who is always mad about stuff and hates a lot of the kitchen staff but has a soft spot for me and the other aide, and today he made a meal just for us. They were chicken-cheese club wraps, which was vastly different from the lunch he was putting together for the nursing home residents, so he really went out of his way to make them. I was honestly touched because he’s so busy and always needs to go 110% to stay on top of things, so the fact that he made such an effort to put something together for us was so nice. But, obviously, it had chicken and cheese, so I politely turned it down by saying that I had just eaten on my break and wasn’t hungry. I felt really bad, though.

I was hoping someone here might understand my worries with telling someone I’m vegan. I’m happy with my new lifestyle and have no intention of changing, but I know that many people have a very negative view of vegans. I don’t want them to distance themselves from me because the see me as pretentious or anything, so I’m wondering how I can subtly tell them I don’t eat meat or animal products. Should I just tell the cook a favorite easy-to-make vegan food for if he ever makes a lunch for us again?

I’m sorry if this question upsets anyone."
vegan,Something I'd really like you to read if you do online activism or are thinking about doing it.,"I've seen a lot of Instagram accounts run by vegans showcasing all the horrors of animal agriculture in its full gory glory and heart-wrenching cruelty, but I've noticed that a lot of this footage is obtained from undercover investigations. I have absolutely zero problem whatsoever with any of this content being shared and I fully endorse and encourage its spread because people need to know where their food comes from, and what this footage shows is what farmers and slaughterhouse workers don't want the consumer to see,

But have you ever thought about examining the things they DO want you to see?

We all know the ""my uncle's farm"" or ""the local farm down the road from me where the cows graze all day"" rhetoric
And I think I may have an excellent way to combat this.

Look no further than homestead/farming accounts.

I have mentioned on this sub before how I find that a lot of the content homesteaders tend to post is even more gross and infuriating to me than what I'd see from a farming TV ad, or hell, even graphic undercover footage oftentimes. And its because of the horrible and disingenuous euphemisms they are constantly using, the extreme glorification of killing and using animals, the twisted attitude of friendly pet we love = our delicious dinner in a few weeks time, and even the downright shameless display of blatant and obvious animal suffering and exploitation they post and then decorate with humanewashing bs or wholesomeification.

I have never seen it worse than with ""meat"" chickens (broilers and cornish crosses) on homesteads. I visited this ""wholesome"" idealistic family homestead account on Instagram before to see what kind of blatant cruelty they were masquerading as wholesome family food production and it really went from 0 to 100 when I got to the posts about their broiler chickens. Posting pictures of the friendly sweet birds unable to even fucking stand or walk under their own weight because of the way they've been selectively bred to produce so much meat, while talking about how lovely and nice it was to be raising organic ""happy"" meat raised outside on grass and bragging about how the chickens were just about ready for ""harvest"" (i.e. execution via throat slitting but obviously they wouldn't say that. I mean, even the word slaughter is too much for them. Gotta go act like the chickens peacefully die in their sleep and become meat) 

What was even worse than the post itself was a comment down below from a fellow homesteader who mentioned her attempts at raising broilers for meat, but how she had made the mistake of letting them live too long past their slaughter date and how they all just died from their lungs being unable to fully expand anymore under their own body weight because they got too big and now in future she will slaughter them at 7 weeks old instead so that they won't have died from suffocation yet. I clicked into her account. Beautiful, wholesome family farm and sweet cute lovable animal photos and videos. 

Years ago I also remember watching ""wholesome"" chick videos on YouTube only to visit the channel one of them was posted on to see that the account owner was also raising broiler chicks for meat and took videos of them outside and in her sweet, friendly sounding voice also quietly mentioned in one part of the video that the chicken was ""starting to struggle to breathe"" at that age. This was such a young bird. Clearly by no means an adult. Not even had reached the age of puberty yet and they were ""struggling to breathe"" - an actual quote from the owner herself.

The evidence is right there. Farmers, small, wholesome, nicest possible, ""humane"", free range farmers admitting and showing how their animals suffer horribly and chickens are suffocating and dying from organ failure in their own bodies because they've been so severely fucked up by our demand for meat. 

I also found a disgusting Instagram dairy farm account where they openly admitted to sending away their cows to be slaughtered as soon as they weren't profitable enough, and then posted about and gloated about how they chopped up one of their cows into pieces and stored her in the fridge after sending her to the butcher because she couldn't make milk anymore and will now feed their family for 2 years. This same cow was one they said they loved to cuddle, And this was a ""humane"" ""fun"" ""wholesome"" ""instagrammable"" dairy farm. You can show this crap to people who tell you dairy doesn't slaughter cows and that good dairy farmers never kill their animals, because this is the shit that ""good farmers"" post. 

There are also countless amounts of photos and videos from ranchers on Instagram of them burning terrified screaming cows with red hot smoking metal and leaving permanant scars so hot the animal's skin is literally glowing orange or burnt to a crisp. Just look at #cattlebranding and you'll find a trove of horrible painful mutilation being laughed at and promoted openly to the public as family friendly fun, even CHILDREN being taught to do this to cows as they scream in pain.

This isn't undercover footage from Dominion. This is the shit farmers themselves post and call humane and showcase as being nice. 

The worst of the worst and the nicest of the nicest have a lot in common. Take this as a great opportunity to prove that all animal agriculture is abhorrent and none is ever innocent and to prove that you are not cherry-picking the worst - This is what the nice farmers want people to see. This is a farmer's pride.

This shit is literally everywhere on social media. Jump in and take as much as you can and post it. Let everyone know the shit their uncle's farm is proud of.

Hope this was helpful.
Peace, and have a good day."
vegan,Are there any vegans/vegetarians here that are in animal science classes?,"I'm studying to be a vet tech and I'm taking 2 animal science classes right now.  One requires me to work on my schools chicken farm and the other teaches me about different animal industries.  The class with the chickens is fun.  We don't use the chickens for meat only eggs.  The only problem with the chicken farm is that we get eggs from a hatchery.  The other class teaches us about genetics, reproduction, and different animal industries.  The problem with this class is that it normalizes factory farming but at least my teacher is against battery cages."

I clicked into her account. Beautiful, wholesome family farm and sweet cute lovable animal photos and videos. 

Years ago I also remember watching ""wholesome"" chick videos on YouTube only to visit the channel one of them was posted on to see that the account owner was also raising broiler chicks for meat and took videos of them outside and in her sweet, friendly sounding voice also quietly mentioned in one part of the video that the chicken was ""starting to struggle to breathe"" at that age. This was such a young bird. Clearly by no means an adult. Not even had reached the age of puberty yet and they were ""struggling to breathe"" - an actual quote from the owner herself.

The evidence is right there. Farmers, small, wholesome, nicest possible, ""humane"", free range farmers admitting and showing how their animals suffer horribly and chickens are suffocating and dying from organ failure in their own bodies because they've been so severely fucked up by our demand for meat. 

I also found a disgusting Instagram dairy farm account where they openly admitted to sending away their cows to be slaughtered as soon as they weren't profitable enough, and then posted about and gloated about how they chopped up one of their cows into pieces and stored her in the fridge because she couldn't make milk anymore and will now feed the family for 2 years. And this was a ""humane"" ""fun"" ""wholesome"" ""instagrammable"" dairy farm. You can show this crap to people who tell you dairy doesn't slaughter cows and that good dairy farmers never kill their animals, because this is the shit that ""good farmers"" post. This wasn't undercover footage from Dominion. This is the shit farmers themselves post and call humane and showcase as lovely. 

The worst of the worst and the nicest of the nicest of farms all have a lot in common. Take this as a great opportunity to prove that all animal agriculture is abhorrent and none is ever innocent and to prove that you are not cherry-picking the worst. This is a farmer's pride.

This shit is literally everywhere on social media. Jump in and take as much as you can. Let everyone know the shit their uncle's farm is proud of.

Hope this was helpful.
Peace, and have a good day."
vegan,documentary suggestions?,"so my sibling is interested in going vegan since i have, but they have problems with their willpower. they agreed to watch a documentary with me to try and convince their subconscious, but i know they couldn’t handle anything very graphic or likely very long. i’ve never seen a documentary myself so i can’t know which ones are good. any suggestions?

vegan,Toxic veganism,"Why do vegans have to be so toxic? Like why? Why do you have to wish death to anyone who is not vegan? I don't wish death to you.  People like you are the reason many don't want to go vegan. Now when I hear ""vegan"" i don't think ""helping animals"" I think ""criminals who case a public disturbance on buses to prove their point."
vegan,potentially triggering anorexia recovery / veganism question,"I have been vegan for almost a decade. I can't imagine myself ever going back to eating meats. That being said after getting an official diagnosis, pretty sure I have been anorexic for years prior (just never accepted it and never cared about my body or weighing myself, forgetting to eat etc) So it has progressed and I'm at this point now where I need to gain weight but the issue is I have absolutely no appetite for anything. The basic things like bread and pasta or even junk food none of it sounds appealing to me anymore. I am starting to notice that as I am eating I feel this like nausea in my stomach that makes it hard to continue to finish my meals. I can't really explain it but it feels very uncomfortable. A few people have urged me to go vegetarian or to start eating meat, but again I cannot imagine myself ever going back to meats. I know that if this is going to just be temporary I would be open to being vegetarian in the meantime, but I am still awaiting to see a nutritionist to find out if this is something they could help me with vegan wise (which I highly doubt). So I'm not sure if anyone has had any similar experiences but I'm trying to figure out what is the quickest way to gain weight as I am having a surgery this year and recovery will be very risky because you can lose up to 10 pounds (liquid diet first few weeks) So I know that if I do have to switch to being vegetarian temporarily it is something that I have to accept. As much as I still can't I just don't know what to do anymore.
&amp; Although it's not what I want I have to focus on my health fitet and it kills me that I may not continue being vegan if things are going to continue this way, because I'm worried that my stomach can no longer process foods especially non-vegan ones so that is my main concern and I was just hoping to get some advice, as I'm not sure if I should even consider going into a treatment center but even then I do not have any financial stability at the moment. Sorry for making this so long and a bit too long and I wish I had more ways to explain this but I am in a situation where it feels a bit hopeless. Thank you in advance to those who read this"
vegan,"My colleagues always agree with me, but don't want to be vegan","I really like my colleagues, they're really nice to everyone, including me. And they really seem to love animals too, dogs, cows, horses, sheep etc.

They agree you shouldn't eat meat, they agree it's inmoral etc. And I didn't force this belief upon them, I just ask them questions to see how they think.

But when I say: So, do you want to be a vegan? then they're like: Naaah.

And they don't have any reason why not.

They do eat a lot of meat in my opinion, so maybe they're scared to change their lifestyle.

At least they don't start saying stupid things like: ""Plants have feelings too.""

Hopefully one day they'll convert, if I can show them the way"
vegan,"the hypocrisy of ""there less sentient""","People say that animals are less sentient which of course they and that justifies harming them or it atleast makes it more ok to harm them than humans, however this less sentience = less moral worth is not applied to any other moral beings. For example, severely mentally disabled people can be less sentient than your average neurotypical human, but if you harm that disabled person, your seen as a disgusting monster and rightfully so. Its seen as much worse than harming a more sentient human because its just gross. Why isn't this applied to animals? If anything harming animals should be considered worse than harming humans using society's logic."
vegan,"For those vegans who care a lot about the environment, how serious are you when it comes to your impact on carbon and environmental footprint?","So while it is true that a plant based diet and vegan fashion and lifestyle as a whole is more environmentally friendly, it's not always the case. Chocolate (even vegan chocolate production) and coffee are only less environmentally damaging than beef, lamb, and cheese. While avocados have a less of a footprint than all animal products it's still higher than most other fruits and veggies. I'm just curious how much vegan environmentalists care about their diet and lifestyle even within veganism."
vegan,boyfriend won’t go vegan,"hey all, I need some honest advice. My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year, and anytime I’ve brought up vegan or even vegetarianism he’s immediately shut down the conversation. Now, mind you, he makes more than enough money to easily go vegan, and does not have any allergies that restrict his protein intake to be solely from meat.

He consistently argues that people who eat meat are “healthier” and that “humans are meant to eat meat”. I’ve told him multiple times this is untrue, and showed him many studies from highly-regarded sources that actually directly contrast his claims. He still refuses to even consider the possibility of going vegan, vegetarian, or even flexitarian.

I told him that if he hunts and solely eats the meat that he hunts, I would be fine with it because that would mean he is simply a cruel person, not an ignorant one. But if he’s going to get meat from a grocery store, and completely skip and ignore all the cruel practices that are used to raise, slaughter, and prepare the animal for sale, then I will not accept his decision to continue eating meat.

Again, he refused, saying that venison has “less nutrients” and is “not as good of a source of protein”. (I don’t know why he immediately assumed I was talking about deer hunting)

I’m kind of burnt out at this point. Not really sure what to do. He refuses to admit he might be wrong, no matter how much evidence I show him that proves he is. He’s never been this volatile or combative with anything else before. He usually immediately apologizes if he’s done something wrong/bad and attempts to remedy the situation.

It’s gotten to the point that, if I see him eat meat and he goes and tries to kiss me afterwards, I’ll just turn my head to the side because I can’t stand the thought of even tasting the poor animal. I’m honestly worried my moral compass will destroy our relationship.

I do love him, and he is a very loving man. He’s always been careful to do everything in his power to make me feel comfortable in our relationship, but advocating for animal rights is such a big part of my life that I’m worried I may actually be doing the wrong thing by staying with him at this point.

Is there anyone who has had a similar situation in the past? Did you manage to get through to them? If so, how?"
vegan,The best gift that made your life a bit easier ?,"I want to buy my S.O. a gift and i searched a lot but to no avail. I usually find it easy to buy gifts but this time i want to rely on others opinions.

vegan,Looking for a specific vegan panel video about the health benefits of meat in extreme circumstances,"https://youtu.be/RSlj-J8IZxw

This is not the video, but it was a similar conference, maybe even had a few of the regular doctors on the panel that frequent it.  I had watched it on YouTube years ago.

Regardless there was one vegan who said in the most extreme circumstances, meat could be a viable alternative for those in dire need, such as from malnutrition.  To put them on it for a few days or weeks and then once they are caught up to normal healthy weight, to remove the meat from them entirely.

I am not here to debate that idea, I just want to know the video and or the doctor that said it.  It was a white male in his mid thirties I believe.  Thank you."

vegan,Couldn’t finish my impossible burger today…,"I’ve been eating these with no issues until today. I accidentally undercooked it just a little bit, so it had a little bit of pink in the center. The texture just reminded me too much of an actual hamburger and it nearly made me sick. I couldn’t even get through a few bites. Does anyone else still get grossed out by fake meat even though it’s not meat at all? I even struggle a little bit with fake bacon and the Just Egg brand. 🤢"
vegan,"I made a mistake today, feeling a little distraught :(","I've been out today and the social anxiety got pretty overwhelming so I decided to stop for tea at a quiet cafe. I thought I was being safe by getting an organic chai but I just double checked the bag they used and it lists honey as an ingredient.

feeling very disappointed with myself that I wasn't more careful, but part of me just hates how conscious you have to be while you're out. It's like there's animal products in every single product honestly 😭"
vegan,"Oh, you're one of *THOSE* vegans...","Yes, I am one of those vegans who takes mass-scale industrialized animal cruelty seriously enough to actually speak up against it and do the things I can to try get it to stop. Sorry that that inconveniences you by reminding you that things you don't like happen. Sorry that your world where massive systematic cruelty magically stops existing without any resistance from the public doesn't actually exist and that this is the real world. Sorry that you'd have to actually go against the grain and not just shut up and do nothing if you want the world to be a better place. Truly, I'm sorry."
vegan,Vegan YouTuber?,"I'm trying to find the channel of a vegan YouTuber I watched a few years ago, and am hoping someone here knows who she is.  At the time, she lived in a small house in Florida (kind of a large shack, really), and she had her refrigerator or some other large appliance on the front porch.  She was maybe in her 30s or 40s, with blond hair.  She had dogs, and some rescue pigs out back, and she played the banjo.  She occasionally had some funny parody videos.  Does this ring a bell for anyone?"
vegan,I wish I could thank every vegan person I met when I was an omni/vegetarian,"They’ll likely never know that they helped me.  Answering my (silly) questions about B12, protein, etc. Showing me good food. Or even just the exposure: the normalization of veganism as an option, socially. 

And shoutout to vcj for not tolerating vegetarianism. My social circle is fully of vegetarians, and it’s pretty easy to convince others of the ease of that transition. But the dairy and egg industry is pretty deep-rooted here still. I’m glad I never tried to get brownie points here or on vcj, but their mockery of the concept and repeated deconstruction made me really examine myself. No one I knew irl was ready to talk about what happens to cows and chickens. I’m glad I finally grew up and took responsibility for my beliefs, and I’m looking forward to what else I can do to bring the knowledge to others. 

I can’t say that it’s true for everyone, but it’s true for me. Thanks, countless people who I’ve met or read from. Every kind interaction, demonstration, and angry retort helped."

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/uycfpe)"
vegan,"Realistic intentions solve real problems, rigid doctrine defined a box.","So, I guess I’m finding a lot of posts on this Reddit disheartening.. for several reasons

1. People do not understand veganism are not lesser than. They are conditioned, and not just by their parents or culture, but by billions of years of omnivorous evolution. 
 

2. There are ethical reasons to kill an animal, especially if it poses a very serious threat to a person. Also, under the realm of veganism… for invasive species and population control. 

3. There is nothing wrong with someone who questions or tries to understand veganism. They should be provided ANSWERS not patronization or hate. There is lots of information about nutrition that urges people away from veganism and many of the shitty attitudes in this community simple endorse the idea we are not healthy. 

4. We ARE omnivores. Sorry. We are built to eat meat. 

Vegan is a “woke” spiritual and intellectual movement about ethics and sustainability. That does not rewrite our history as evolved mammals and it does not make omnivores monsters."
vegan,Milk has the flavour profile of vomit - Butyric acid,"Barista gave me a cappuccino with dairy milk today, it was strange because I immediately recognized the flavour as vomity! Well it turns out that flavour is Butyric acid, naturally found in vomit and mammal milk.

I used to have dairy milk in my cereal every day, but I suppose our palate accommodates certain flavours which is why I never appreciated how gross milk tastes.

Curious if anyone else has accidentally tasted milk since going vegan and if you also disliked the flavour."
vegan,How Do I Start Being Vegan?,"Now I have ate meat practically my whole life (basically whatever my mom cooks/buys me) but this year ima be moving out and I was wondering how to start being vegan/vegetarian since now ill have full control over what I eat etc.  


I know I just really hate salads a lot, the last time I ate a salad I quite literally threw up and my stomach ached for a day."
vegan,"I tend to bicker w other vegans over strategy on how to grow veganism, but I'm becoming more &amp; more convinced that it's completely stupid.","I tend to be more in favor of a gentle approach (i.e. calling out actions rather than people, offering recipes to those who are interested in going vegan) and I tend to get salty when I see other vegans goin' around comparing vegetarians to serial killers or saying we should abandon any friends or family who won't go vegan. But more and more, I've been thinking that having a variety of advocacy styles is good since all omnis are different and will respond well to differing tactics.

And besides, we don't have (to my knowledge) statistical evidence that one style of advocacy is more effective than any other. Maybe we all need to chill out and focus on the real adversary, which is carnism."
vegan,Can a vegan ever be an astronaut?,"I'm a little unclear on the details of vegan opposition to animal testing. In the 60s, before we were sure it was possible for a living thing to survive in space, we send up monkeys, thus meaning that rockets are a technology built on animal testing. My understanding is that veganism entails not using technologies and products that were tested on animals.

Where I'm unclear is - why does it matter if they were tested on animals in the past? The goal is to reduce animal suffering, but the animal flights already happened. An astronaut getting on a rocket today does not add more suffering. Right?

I'm not aiming to argue - just to learn. This just feels like something I'm failing to understand and I'd love to have things clarified a bit."
vegan,Just emailed some influencers,I realised one of my favourite vegan brands has some brand ambassadors which are not actually vegan. The products are delicious so I am not surprised Omni’s are also obsessed with them but it doesn’t sit well with me that they are not actually vegan when representing a vegan brand. I think most of them are genuinely in the dark so just emailed a few of them urging them to watch Dominion. They have very large followings so it would be great if one of them considered becoming vegan. Fingers crossed 🤞

vegan,"How many people here have heard of Dr Sebi, or Alfredo Bowman, the man who cured AIDS, HIV, cancer, diabetes, sickle cell anemia, schizophrenia, and a huge list of other diseases?","Just to give everyone a simple biography, he was a man who was diagnosed with diabetes and asthma before seeking holistic treatment from a Mexican herbalist who had opened his mind to the world of holistic health and beginning his own endeavor to study the intracellular relationship between the food we eat and our bodies. After much experimentation he was able to achieve the unthinkable and cured himself of both diabetes and asthma. He discovered that the human body is meant to be an alkaline body and anything acidic that we ate was compromising the mucus membrane that is meant to protect us, causing deleterious effects that result in disease including all of the world’s most prominent diseases. Once he realized that mucus is the root of all disease he began treating patients and undoubtedly curing them one by one by approaching their disease given this same principle (Before you says it isn’t true I actually know people who have been cured by him of HIV, paralysis, cancer and so on). The federal government caught wind of his so called cure for AIDS and decided to sue, in which the first victory after over several thousand cases before him was achieved and he was free of any allegations against him after bringing 77 of his cured patients to court. He’s revolutionized the way human beings understand their history as well as how far we’ve divorced ourselves from our true nature. Although he passed away sometime fairly recent, Usha Village in Honduras is still welcome to any potential patients who may be seeking treatment as the rest of his family continues to share his formulas and education."
vegan,Converting from Vegetarian to Vegan,"Hi folks, I've been a vegetarian (In India) my whole life and I'm now considering the benefits of moving to a complete vegan diet. Can I get any pointers on how I can replace calcium and other nutrients that I got from cow milk? I'm happy with soy milk but the only options I see are fortified with everything except calcium.

Also, have any of you made a transition from using leather to NOT using it as part of this? I want to completely stop using any animal products and I'm wondering what to do with the leather I have right now."
vegan,"What are some of your favorite shelf stable vegan foods (for emergency use, which require little to no preparation)?","Hi all,

I'm relatively new to veganism (as of earlier this month), and am still working my way through the 30-day vegan bootcamp (as seen over on the sidebar).

After getting some of the other recent-convert items squared away, it's now time for me to turn my attention to replacing our emergency food stores.  We're no preppers by any means, but stuff happens, and as such we typically keep two weeks of food, water, and other necessities on hand.  For food, we go for stuff that is shelf stable and requires either no preparation, or can be prepared using only cold/unheated water.

I've historically aimed for more calorie dense food to reduce storage space, and a lot of what I need to replace is stuff like spam, corned beef hash, canned soups, ramen, etc.

Vegan stuff that I currently have on hand, and will be expanding includes peanut butter, canned fruits and vegetables, and oatmeal.  I've googled and read about rice-cakes and packaged rice milk that supposedly lasts a long time, but I have yet to check and verify this (all the plant milks I've bought so far - soy, almond, oat, and cashew - have all come out of the refrigerated section of the store).

Anyway, as I go through this process I'd be interested in learning what other foods are super shelf stable and require no heat/prep that other people like and keep on hand.

Thanks in advance for any input!"

vegan,Just Eggs went bad before I opened the bottle …,"And the best before date is June 5th!! This is my second bottle - I couldn’t stop raving about Just Eggs when I tried it the first time but now I’m not so sure.

The second bottle was chunkier and took way longer to cook together in the pan, plus it smelled funky… but I figured it was in my head so I just went for it, and it was ~unpleasant ~ in the tummy. I smelled it again and decided to toss it - there was a big chunky mass at the bottom. 😒

Does anyone else have these experiences? I’m wondering if it’s a bad batch? At this price point though, yikes. I want to love it, but that’s a lot of wasted product and money."

I’m going to Greece this summer—last time I was there I only ate dairy but I noticed 99% of the food was meat or fish. It’s not just that I don’t want to eat meat. Like I literally cannot. It’s not how I was raised and the thought makes me sick. 

Tips on how to be polite and foods to look for that will keep me full? Super filling veggies? I’m assuming I’ll be eating a lot of sides.

vegan,Is veganism important in a relationship? Should it affect it?,"I’ve been sick to my stomach trying to figure this out and I’ve been procrastinating forever because I wasn’t sure where would be a good place to post this. I gotta bite the bullet because it’s really bugging me.

Im vegan, I started dating a woman who is not.

I told her before we started dating that I could only date a vegan. It’s my biggest and pretty much only boundary. She agreed and said her diet wasn’t important to her. 

Now she has decided that she doesn’t want to be vegan anymore after a long time and has given up. I am now in a committed relationship with her and I’ve already let myself get to know her and fall in love. She’s an amazing fit for me, the best yet, but she has no interest in eating vegan other than initially. She decided not to because she would miss the taste/ the experiences and convenience.

My biggest problem that it is very disturbing for me to watch, smell, or be around. It breaks my heart, makes me sad and feel guilty.  It’s been making me anxious and extremely depressed. It disgust me. I’m finding myself unattracted to her because of it. It’s a mess. The only reason I agreed was because I was drunk when she brought it up of course. 

My question is… what do I do? Should I learn to cope? I am willing always if it is the right thing to do. Or should I tell her how hard it is for me to be with someone like this and ask her to reconsider? Or terminate our relationship altogether? Discuss more compromises? Or if you have any advice share below please…. I’m always willing to talk to her, I just really can’t tell what the right thing to do is. Asking In r/vegan because I know I’ll get vegan hate otherwise. 


Let me note that I really do love this woman. She is a kind girl but very carefree. She doesn’t believe it’s right, but still eats it anyway because of the inconvenience…"
vegan,Tempeh texture,"I bought tempeh (Trader Joe and Lightlife) and I've been experimenting with tempeh recipes but here are the things I notice

\- The texture is too crumbly. I like soft and hard tofu, I like seitan's chewiness, but there is something about the half-soft, half-crumbly nature of tempeh that just...meh

So far the only one I like is in Vietnamese summer roll (wrapped in a bunch of things, so you don't notice the bad).

Am I doing anything wrong here? Should I try fermenting my own tempeh to get better texture? Any brand you recommend? (US-based)?"

vegan,Two egg laying chicken eat the same amount of calories as one human in a day,"Hi all,

We all know that eating animal products is inefficient, not only unethical. But how inefficient is it?

My daily calorie intake on a vegan diet is around 2600 kcal and I eat around 15% protein. An egg laying chicken eats 1300 kcal. Basically my whole day of eating equals the calories of 2 chicken and they eat the same amount of protein, 15%.

These two chicken lay maximum 2 eggs per day. These two eggs, if I were not vegan, would have provided me 7% of calories and 11% of protein. That's not even one mean for me, it would barely have the nutrients of a snack yet it is equivalent to my whole daily budget of calories and protein on a vegan diet.

You might feel bad when you throw away veggies because you did not cook them in time and they got bad but if an omnivore throws away just two eggs, they throw away the equivalent of your entire day's equivalent in food.

Sorry for straying the conversation away from the ethics but this for me was mind blowing. I did not include all the non-food resources these animals need such as antibiotics, water, heating or electricity."

Now.. their is two kind of people. Those who will say to me "" You parents are total jerks, they should feed and care about you because they are your family. "" and "" Your parents are in their rights because you are still under their roof even if you are legal, they can do that. ""

Understand with me this ; I will not be able to escape because I will live with my family forever, it's our economic situation and wish of life. I have no money, no support, no transportation."
vegan,Vegan Birthday Party- What do I serve the non-vegans?,"Me and my kids are vegan and have been for our entire lives and we're hosting a pool party/cookout over the weekend and there are non-vegan guests. I've never had non vegan guests over for a meal in my entire adult life. What am I supposed to serve them? 

Should I just get pizza or something from the store, or maybe pre-made subs from the Publix? Any other ideas? While I don't mind cooking something non-vegan, my kid doesn't want to smell flesh on her birthday so I'm not going to ruin her birthday."
vegan,Help with a vegan argument - why not just humans deserve recognition,"I'm arguing with a friend about veganism. Basically his argument is like this: most of the humans help society, therefore all of the humans (including babies, old people, sick people etc.) deserve moral recognition. I said that he uses two different criteria for who deserves moral recognition - being a human and helping the society, so he told me that it's alright because humanity is the body that contains all humans who help society. I think this an arbittary choice of the body but he does'nt listen. Any easy way to debunk that argument?"

vegan,How do you feel about content creators who aren't vegan?,"So, the question stands. 

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, I have to add that I am a determinist. I do believe that people can be and are mislead to be meat eaters (which I was one of), murderers, rapists, mentally damaged etc. I can even empathize.

&amp;#x200B;

While I do not believe in guilt and do not think that people who are just uneducated deserve any punishment, I still feel strong that my own moral compass is right. That I live by ""Enjoy your life to the maximum, without hurting anyone or anything"".

&amp;#x200B;

I still question myself about content creators whose contents I thoroughly enjoy. Am I wrong to do so? I will name a specific example. YouTuber by the name of Modern History TV. The YouTuber in question is Jason Kingsley.

&amp;#x200B;

Jason is a meat eater and history re-enactor. He lives on a farm, I suppose, and has several horses which he rides. While I do not like animal exploitation, I have to say he has amazing facts about medieval history of England, that have broadened my epic fantasy mind.  I am writing a fantasy story in my spare time and I do find knights in shining armor amazing. But, more often than not, knights are cavalry, riding horses. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mind is very confused. I am in love with knights and their horse riding, but I still feel obligated not to encourage it. I am also slightly drunk, and not in control of my decisions, ergo this post.

I’m looking at the Oppo Find X2 model and Google keeps mentioning a vegan leather back but I can’t find confirmation that the phone itself doesn’t use any animal based products. 

Does anyone know if they are vegan?

And I’m aware of Fairphone too, I believe they are very environmentally friendly - but are they vegan also?

Thanks!"
vegan,What should I do with the eggs ?,I rescued some chickens on the weekend and they have laid a few eggs. I don’t feel comfortable eating them but was wondering if I should give them away so hopefully they displace some that friends or family might buy from the supermarket ? Or should I just leave them and hopefully that will mean they will stop laying them ? Do chickens like to lay eggs if they are happy and healthy or does it distress them when they are taken away ?

I've been vegan since February 15th, before that i was on hormonal birth control but stopped taking it  due to health reasons. 

Ever since mid-April I've been getting my period every two weeks. It only lasts a couple days and is light. I had very irregular periods before birth control and being vegan. I just had a pap smear and I did have abormal cells but not cancer related, but my doctor wants to do another one in a year. I am 22. 

Not sure if it's being vegan or stopping birth control or both? I have a follow up with my doctor next month and I will definitely mention it to her."

vegan,Interesting ethical dilemma scenario:,"Lab grown animal free animal products (eggs, dairy, meat, sea stuff, honey) are soon to be hitting shelves. This is excellent news for animals, the environment, efficiency, and cost for low income people. Let’s say the whole world, not just vegans, will now no longer be allowed to use/kill animals (or the “farms”  will go out of business because of lack of efficiency and exposing their cruelty that is no longer viewed as “necessary” by animal eaters) and lab grown is now the only legally available source. However, imagine someone you live with has leftover animal sourced animal flesh/other products lying around. They don’t care about the difference between the animal ones and the animal free lab grown ones and use up your cultured animal free “animal” products. Would it be ethical to eat the actual animal ones if this will not at all lead to any more purchases of the products since only animal free is available, and not using them would be wasting and even more disrespectful go to the animal’s life? This is different from some “freegan” arguments and arguments asking if it’s ethical to eat animals if their muscle tissue/unfertilized eggs/breast milk is already bought or prepared, since in this case it’s mot going to lead to any more consumption of or purchasing of animal items and instead more of the animal free products that are not actually the parts of an animal.

vegan,Wedding and Friendmoon in London and Greece as a vegan,"Hello, everyone!  I’m an American who’s got his routine down and I was quite nervous about going over seas where no meal is guaranteed.  Here is my POSITIVE experience. As the best man, I had no choice but to go with my cork dress shoes/belt and all. The airport in London has more vegan options than not! So much hope was instilled at that moment. Every event for the wedding had vegan options including the rehearsal and cocktail parties etc.  Eating out in london, every single restaurant has options for me.  It’s so amazing to see.  My neck of the woods in New England is nothing like this.  The small island in Greece I’m on has been an absolute struggle tho but everyone around is so supportive. We have about 40 people here. I’ll get random messages from people in our party with pictures with restaurants that have a vegan option. Everyone tells me how much they respect veganism. We have people from Australia, London, Hong Kong, United States, Canada and it’s so interesting to see everyone’s takes on it.  Some of them are professional athletes who are starting to adopt a plant-based diet.  This has just been an amazing experience and I wanted to share it, with all the negativity posed on this sub about hopeless social dynamics.   I hope everyone can experience the same! If you haven’t, visit London: it’s amazing for a vegan.  🥂 🌱"

vegan,"Cat, dog, and equine rescue needs help urgently!","Hi guys! I volunteer with Crazy Cat Lady Rescues, a cat rescue located in Rabat, Morocco. I am writing to ask for help on behalf of a separate Moroccan animal rescue that has been struggling for quite a while, Morocco Animal Aid.

Morocco Animal Aid is a dog, cat, and equine rescue and rehabilitation centre located in southern Morocco. Morocco Animal Aid takes in the animals that need it most, such as dogs that have been hit by cars and left to die, mules that have been worked to the brink of death, and kittens separated from their mothers and left to starve. They take these animals off the street, give them the care they need to recover, and provide them a safe home until they are (hopefully) adopted. Additionally, they are working hard to establish acceptance of spayed/neutered &amp; vaccinated strays within their community, where these animals are often killed for simply existing.

With over 500 animals currently in their care, Morocco Animal Aid is struggling to keep their head above water. In April of this year, they made a post to their Instagram stating that they only had $0.14 left in their bank account. Today, their rescue shared this message:

*""Here's something that we're not only embarrassed about but also heartbroken over: it's May 24th and no one from our team has been paid in full for April.*  


*Yes, April.*  


*Many haven't even had half of their wage. Some haven't had any wage at all.*  


*It's absolutely horrible. We want to sink into the Earth with our shame in tow.*  


*But the thing is, it's not because we don't want to pay them.*  


*My god, we do! We want to pay them on the 1st of every month and give them bonuses and show them they're valued but instead, we're met with empty bank accounts and no donations.*  


*They, too, need to provide for themselves and have a life, not just the animals that we rescue.*  


*But herein lies the second issue...our food bill. It increased again and now it's over 9.000 eur that we spend every month just to buy cat and dog croquettes.*  


*With the remainder of wages still to be paid for April—5.400 eur—and food money, we need to raise 14.400 eur.*  


*Just putting that number down tightens the knot in our stomach but if we don't somehow almost magically get that ASAP, our workers will start walking away.*  


*They can't work for an employer that can't pay them, it's reasonable.*  


*But that would mean there wouldn't be enough people to take care of the animals at all our locations. It means less care, less food, more chaos, more injuries and absolutely nothing—nothing—good.*  


*It's the last thing that we want.*  


*If you feel so inspired, please donate for our team's wages and our food order. Please.*  


*PayPal donate@moroccoanimalaid.com or message us for our bank details.*  


*Thank you for the help. It's urgent and we cannot do it without you.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Last year, Crazy Cat Lady Rescues was contacted by a women desperately needing help with a dog she had found on the side of the road who was paralyzed from the waist down due to a road traffic accident. We did what we could to arrange vet visits for her and this dog; where he could receive treatment and stay temporarily in ICU. Unfortunately, as an over-capacity cat rescue, we had nowhere to keep him long-term. After reaching out to Morocco Animal Aid, they agreed to take in the dog, continue his treatment, and even got him a canine wheelchair. 

Morocco Animal Aid is an amazing organization that truly makes the world a better place. I am frightened by how much they are struggling. So, I am reaching out here to ask you all to please share their cause or donate if you can. There are over 500 animals that need your help.

vegan,Are the prices of vegan foods decreasing?,"I am used to paying more for the vegan alternative to non-vegan products, but this week I happened to notice many places have started charging the same price for both. At Dunkin a vegan donut costs the same as a non-vegan donut, the Burger King vegan chicken sandwich costs the same as the meat one, and even my gym was charging the same for vegan and whey protein powder!! Maybe I live in a vegan bubble (Berlin lol), so I am curious to know if others are seeing the same thing? Maybe things are slowly changing!"
vegan,Family Birthday won’t have any vegan options because uncle don’t want to pay for options without meat/cheese,"I’ve got a family birthday to go (my cousin’s) and it’s important that I go so I don’t create a massive feud in the family (yes they are that dramatic) so I asked my aunt if there will be any vegan options in the venue (which happen to be quite a good looking/fancy one) and she said “No, your uncle didn’t want to pay extra for vegan options, there might be something you can eat in the Chinese selection”. 

Like they make such a big deal of me being there and then don’t bother spending, idk, 5% more to have some options that are not meat or dairy/eggs?? Besides, it is not like Someone who isn’t vegan will die if they eat something that didn’t come from death or abuse. I’m genuinely stressed and angered at the lack of consideration my own family has towards me.

Sorry for the rant but I really felt like I needed to share this."
vegan,At the BBQ,"Where I live, it was Victoria Day yesterday.  This holiday typically is celebrated with a backyard BBQ followed by viewing fireworks.  I was invited to a friend's house, where various carcasses were being grilled.  However, I and the one other vegan who showed up had the following:

* grilled rapini 
* grilled eggplant
* hummus, used with chopped broccoli, carrots, red peppers, and cucumber
* potato (wonderfully done in the BBQ)
* grilled pineapple
* grilled firm tofu
* grilled mushrooms (no-name misshaped mushrooms, which are large enough but nice and cheap)

And there were buns to make sandwiches, if we chose to do so (with typical condiments, like onions, pickles, tomatoes, mustard and ketchup, along with a home make scotch bonnet pepper sauce, if we were brave enough).  Corn on the cob in the husk is also good for grilling, though we didn't have any.  We also grilled some red coloured leaves, which I think was a type of lettuce (it was okay, but the rapini was better).  Most of the grilled stuff was brushed with some seasoned oil to make it yummier.

So, lots of options for vegans."
vegan,Any fellow vegan agricultural workers/scientists?,"Hello everyone! I wonder if I can meet here any other folks who work in this super important field :) I have a bachelor's degree in agronomy, and currently I work at a local agricultural research station. So far I'm just an intern, but soon I will be taught potato and strawberry micropropagation, and I'm super excited about this! I wanted to study biotechnology for the master's degree, but the world events messed up the plans, so I will get a master's degree in general biology and learn the needed skills at the station at the same time, so my research will still be about plant biotechnology or genetics."
vegan,I’m going to make the best bbq takeaway in my area and it’s going to be vegan!,"There is a huge gap in the market in my area for a bbq style meat takeaway (burgers, pulled pork, brisket, chicken wings etc), there is only a couple takeaways that are on just eat and they are both pizza places. 

The only thing is I want to do it purely vegan! I don’t want to market it as ‘vegan’ because the label has negative connotations but my vision is to create meat free bbq food that meat eaters love and vegans love, and I think its that simple. I can use seitan for a lot of the products and meat substitutes are getting crazy good now, and if I can nail the texture and flavour of bbq meat without the killing it’s a no brainer for me (I get a lot of people don’t think like this yet). 

I want to inspire people through positive experiences that meat can be vegan, because a lot of people think vegans can be preachy but I get it’s just passion. However I want to inspire not point fingers. 

Anyway… I’d love to hear any recipes or ideas/YouTube videos etc that you know of to help me in this quest! I’m calling for the naughty side of veganism not the ultra healthy stuff, I’m talking sticky bbq vegan recipes 🔥🔥

Thank you, peace and love!"
vegan,Add monkeypox to the list !,"So monkeypox has been all the talk in the news as of late, with many cases spreading across various countries. And although its not a new virus — it was discovered in 1958, its a reminder of how humanity never learns from its past mistakes of animal exploitation. Another zoonotic disease to add to the list of viruses and diseases which have come as a result of either animal farming, wet markets, animal consumption or live trade. Shocker!   


*""Since the first reported human case, monkeypox has been found in* [*several other central and western African countries*](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/about.html)*, with the majority of infections in the DRC.

vegan,Are all birds created equal?,"Story-time!

I spent the long weekend visiting my family. While out shopping we stop for a quick meal where I (30M) order a beyond meat burger and my sister (33F) orders a chicken burger. We drive to the next store and my sister is in the front finishing her burger before heading inside. I make some goofy faces at her through the car window and she “taunts” me with her almost finished chicken burger. Without missing a beat I respond with “want me to tell you some fun facts?” She quickly says no and we move on with our outing. 

Then,

We are driving along the countryside and an unsuspecting small bird flies out from the woods and unfortunately gets hit by our car. My sister checks her mirrors and is horrified to see the aftermath as it’s run over by the cars behind us. She’s visibly upset, but I’m more bewildered than anything because less than 20 minutes ago she was happily chomping down on a chicken burger and even jokingly taunting me with it. I try not to be the “preachy vegan” since I’m the only one in my family but I couldn’t help but call out the situation as a prime example of hypocrisy. 

“Why are you so upset about that bird, when you just happily ate one earlier?” She didn’t have any response in the moment, however, later that day when the two of us were on our own she said that I’ve inspired her and she’s going to start thinking more about her choices and the impacts they have. I don’t know if she’ll go full vegan just yet but it’s progress!"
vegan,How did going vegan affect your cognitive function/reaction time/focus?,"Hello, I'm thinking about going vegan and one of my main concerns about veganism is the way it may affect my performance, i.e. reaction time, ability to focus, overall cognitive skills.

vegan,Its come to this EITHER feed animals for slaughter OR feed people - time for the world to choose!,"""Ukraine and Russia account for [29 per cent of global wheat exports](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/video/2022/04/05/the-impact-of-the-war-in-ukraine-on-food-security-world-bank-expert-answers) and 62 per cent of sunflower oil...""  
""...In Ukraine itself, the United Nations has described [extensive damage and loss of life in rural areas](https://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cb9171en/) as well as key population centres, sparking fears that crops may not get planted.  
""...grain exports have almost entirely shut down since the start of the invasion, the war hitting factories and farmers’ ability to work. Distribution of last year’s harvest has been affected along with the production of fresh produce this year, and perhaps in the coming years.""  
""Despite the apparent scarcity, the reality is that we live in a world which produces twice as much food calories as we need – so why the sudden shortage?

A big part of the answer lies with one of the food system’s biggest ‘elephants in the room’: the grain-feeding of industrially farmed animals. Much of our wheat and other crops is fed to animals who are mostly confined in cages, crates, windowless barns or feedlots.

Intensive animal rearing, or factory farming, has put farm animals directly in competition with people for food. **And people are losing out**. **Most of the food value of wheat and other grains in terms of both calories and protein is wasted in conversion to intensively farmed meat, milk and eggs.""**

vegan,"""You don't really care about animals...""","My family has said I don't really care about animals because I'm not rescuing (do they want me to illegally steal them from farmers to prove I care?) or outside protesting and making my whole life about it (yet they complain I talk about it too much).  


My response is I care enough to not actively cause them harm. It's the least we can do if we truly care about them at all. However, I am actively protesting by communicating the issue with people I interact with who are still actively contributing to the problem.  


Just wanted to share this. Has anyone else had someone tell them something like this?"
vegan,Argument against eating game animals?,"So, my family owns a forest and for legal as well as environmental it is a necessity to hunt the wild population annually to keep the numbers to a sustainable level. I personally do not eat the meat, but my brother does, and we had an argument about it. He does not eat any meal coming from farmed animals, but considers wild fair, because ""they have to be hunted anyway, and otherwise it would just be wasting the meat"". I feel like from his perspective, it's a fair and logic argument, because, in the current situation, the deer &amp; boar population has to be artificially culled, otherwise they would destroy the forest. However, I also feel there is more about this argument that goes beyond ""eating meat is disgusting"" from a vegan perspective. Any takers?

 Please under the premise that the culling is a necessity at the moment, because I don't feel like arguing with people who don't know much about the legalities and context of forest management in my country (No, introducing natural predators is not possible here at the moment, no, deer contraception is not an alternative here at the moment, no, you can not just let nature sort it out)"
vegan,Question regarding quarantine,"Greetings, fellow vegans. I was vegan for two years already. Whilst I don't find animal products disgusting, I have no desire to eat them. This month, I can finally move to the country my graduate school is in. The problem, however, is that I have to quarantine under the odd rule that I can only eat from the convenience store within the hotel. I've patrolled the store several rounds and found the vegan food lacks both quantity and variety. I know that the goal of veganism is to ""reduce animal suffering as far as is possible and practicable"". Technically, it is possible to chew on the same three food for an entire week, but I'm not sure if doing so is too demanding? I am willing to try, but right now, I can not but dread the prospect of having Inari sushi, Natto sushi, and chips for the coming 24 meals. Any thoughts?"
vegan,Omega Confusion,"I am trying to ensure I am getting all my nutrients on a vegan diet without using supplements (besides b12). I am finding the conversation around Omegas confusing and I am wondering if anyone has feedback on my plan to obtain my omega with the guidelines below:

Omega 3 - either via flaxseed in morning smoothie or hot cereal, or hemp seeds on salad, or handful of walnuts as a snack

Omega 6 - walnuts or safflower oil in salad dressing

I feel like this is a really simple solution but I keep hearing about the need to supplement so maybe I am missing something?"
vegan,I need some help,Hello everyone :) I’m learning about how eating meat harms animals and how eating less of it can help the environment and I wanna do what I can to help. But I have one problem. I kind of hate vegetables. Except carrots but in general I hate them. I also don’t like any of the vegan foods I’ve seen so far. I  also like dairy products but I really don’t want to keep contributing to something that will harm other species.I wanna try my best to help but I just can’t make the change. It’s really hard. Any suggestions? Thank you!
